Andromeda321,astro   reward3,Grad Student |  Radio Astronomy,"Astronomer here!  Here is what is going on!

For many years, astronomers have speculated that the most likely way to find evidence of extraterrestrial life is via [biosignatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosignature), which are basically substances that provide evidence of life.  Probably the most famous example of this would be oxygen- it rapidly oxidizes in just a few thousand years, so to have large quantities of oxygen in an atmosphere you need something to constantly be putting it there (in Earth's case, from photoplankton and trees).  Another one that's been suggested as a great biosignature is [phosphine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine)- a gas we can only make on Earth in the lab, or via organic matter decomposing (typically in a water-rich environment, which Venus is not).  So, to be abundantly clear, the argument here is to the best of our knowledge you should *only* get this concentration of phosphine if there is life.

***What did this group discover?  Is the signal legit?*** These scientists basically pointed [a submillimeter radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell_Telescope) towards Venus to look for a signature of phosphine, which was not even a very technologically advanced radio telescope for this sort of thing, but they just wanted to get a good benchmark for future observations.  And... they found a phosphine signature.  They then pointed another, better radio telescope at it ([ALMA](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/alma/)- hands down best in the world for this kind of observation) and measured this signal even better.  I am a radio astronomer myself, and looking at [the paper]( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1174-4), I have no reason to think this is *not* the signature from phosphine they say it is.  They spend a lot of time estimating other contaminants they might be picking up, such as sulfur dioxide, but honestly those are really small compared to the phosphine signal.  There's also a lot on the instrumentation, but they do seem to understand and have considered all possible effects there.

***Can this phosphine be created by non-life?*** The authors also basically spend half the paper going through allllll the different possible ways to get phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus.  If you go check ""extended data Figure 10"" in the paper they go through all of the options, from potential volcanic activity to being brought in from meteorites to lightning... and all those methods are either impossible in this case, or would not produce you the concentration levels needed to explain the signature by several orders of magnitude (like, literally a million times too little).  As I said, these guys were very thorough, and brought on a lot of experts in other fields to do this legwork to rule options out!  And the only thing they have not been able to rule out so far is the most fantastic option. :) The point is, *either we don’t get something basic about rocky planets, or life is putting this up there.*

(Mind, the way science goes I am sure by end of the week someone will have thought up an idea on how to explain phosphine in Venus's atmosphere.  Whether that idea is a *good* one remains to be seen.)

To give one example, It should be noted at this point that phosphine has apparently been detected in comets- specifically, it’s thought to be behind in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the Rosetta mission- [paper link]( https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/5/e1600285).  Comets have long been known to have a ton of organic compounds and are water rich- some suggest life on Earth was seeded by comets a long time ago- but it’s *also* present in the coma of comets as they are near the sun, which are *very* different conditions than the Venusian atmosphere. (It’s basically water ice sublimating as it warms up in a comet, so an active process is occurring in a water-rich environment to create phosphine.) However, the amounts created are nowhere near what is needed for the amounts of phosphine seen in Venus, we do not have water anywhere near the levels on Venus to make these amounts of phosphine, and we have detailed radar mapping to show us there was no recent cometary impact of Venus.  As such, it appears highly unlikely that what puts phospine into Venus’s atmosphere is the same as what puts it into a comet’s coma.  [Research into this also indicates that, surprise surprise, cometary environments are very different than rocky ones, and only life can put it in the atmosphere of a rocky planet.]( http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/phosphine-biosignature-gas-07957.html
)

***How can life exist on Venus?  I thought it was a hell hole!*** The surface of Venus is indeed not a nice place to live- a runaway greenhouse effect means the surface is hot enough to melt lead, it rains sulfuric acid, and the Russian probes that landed there in didn't last more than a few hours. (No one has bothered since the 1980s.) However, if you go about 50 km up Venus's atmosphere is the most Earth-like there is in the Solar System, and this is where this signal is located. What's more, unlike the crushing pressure and hot temperatures on the surface, you have the same atmospheric pressure as on Earth, temps varying from 0-50 C, and pretty similar gravity to here.  [People have suggested we could even build cloud cities there.](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20161019-the-amazing-cloud-cities-we-could-build-on-venus) And this is the region this biosignature is coming from- not the surface, but tens of km up in the pretty darn nice area to float around in.

Plus, honestly, you know what I’m happy about that will come out of this?  More space exploration of Venus!  It is a fascinating planet that is criminally under-studied despite arguably some of the most interesting geology and atmosphere there is that we know of. (My favorite- Venus’s day is longer than its year, and it rotates “backwards” compared to all the other planets.  But we think that’s not because of the way it formed, but because some gigantic planet-sized object hit it in the early days and basically flipped it upside down and slowed its spin.  Isn’t that so cool?!) But we just wrote it off because the surface is really tough with old Soviet technology, and NASA hasn’t even sent a dedicated mission in over 30 years despite it being *literally the closest planet to us*.  I imagine that is going to change *fast* and I am really excited for it- bring on the Venus drones!

[***So, aliens?***](https://media.giphy.com/media/RluM0kvZXkLS0/giphy.gif) I mean, personally if you're asking my opinion as a scientist... I think I will always remember this discovery as the first step in learning how common life is in the universe. :) To be clear, the ""problem"" with a biosignature is it does *not* tell you what is putting that phosphine into the Venusian atmosphere- something microbial seems a good bet (we have great radar mapping of Venus and there are def no cloud cities or large artificial structures), but as to what, your guess is as good as mine.  We do know that [billions of microbes live high up in the Earth's atmosphere](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/microbes-survive-and-maybe-thrive-high-atmosphere), feeding as they pass through clouds and found as high as 10km up.  So I see no reason the same can't be happening on Venus! (It would be life still pretty darn ok with sulfuric acid clouds everywhere, mind, but we have extremophiles on Earth in crazy environments too so I can’t think of a good reason why it’s *impossible*).

If you want to know where the smoking gun is, well here's the thing... Hollywood has well trained you to think otherwise, but I have always argued that discovering life elsewhere in the universe was going to be like discovering water on Mars.  Where, as you might recall, first there were some signatures that there was water on Mars but that wasn't conclusive on its own that it existed, then a little more evidence came in, and some more... and finally today, everyone knows there is water on Mars.  There was no reason to think the discovery of life wouldn't play out the same, because that's how science operates. (This is also why I always thought people were far too simplistic in assuming we would all just drop everything and unite as one just because life was discovered elsewhere- there'd be no smoking gun, and we'd all do what we all are doing now, get on social media to chat about it.) But put it this way- today we have taken a really big first step.  And I think it is *so amazing* that this was first discovered not only next door, but on a planet not really thought of as great for life- it shows there's a good chance life in some for is ubiquitous!  And I for one cannot wait until we can get a drone of some sort into the Venusian atmosphere to measure this better- provided, of course, we can do it in a way that ensures our own microbes don't hitch a ride.

TL;DR- if you count microbes, which I do, we are (probably) not alone. :D

Edit: There will be a Reddit AMA Wednesday at noon EDT from the team at /r/askscience!

**Edit 2: A lot of questions about whether this could just be from bacteria that hitched a ride on our old probes.  The short answer is that's not really possible at the levels detected.  Life as we have it on Earth can't survive on Venus because of all the sulfuric acid clouds and such.  Even if something managed to do so, bacteria don't reproduce as fast as would be needed to explain this signal.**",1600097666,1600123133.0,g58oqsr,False,t3_ismhzh,t3_ismhzh,1600170772,19444,False,science,t5_mouw

Seevian,,,"&gt; *The largest study to report a rise in the stillbirth rate, based on data from more than 20,000 women who gave birth in 9 hospitals across Nepal, was published in The Lancet Global Health on 10 August1. It reported that stillbirths increased from 14 per 1,000 births before the country went into lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus in late March, to 21 per 1,000 births by the end of May — a rise of 50%. The sharpest rise was observed during the first four weeks of the lockdown, under which people were allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and receive essential care.*

&gt; *The increase in the proportion of stillbirths among hospital births was not caused by COVID-19 infections, says K.C.. Rather, it is probably a result of how the pandemic has affected access to routine antenatal care, which might have otherwise picked up complications that can lead to stillbirth, he says. Pregnant women might have been unable to travel to health facilities for lack of public transport; in some cases, antenatal appointments were reportedly cancelled. Others might have avoided hospitals for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or had consultations by phone or Internet. Disruptions brought about by the pandemic have also been linked to a rise in deaths from heart disease and diabetes.*

So, just to clarify, the spike in stillbirth seems to be tied to lack of access to medical care due to COVID, not due to COVID itself",1600198748,,g5e5ff5,False,t3_itffq2,t3_itffq2,1600271802,6707,False,science,t5_mouw

Wagamaga,  reward1,,"Prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to severe health problems in humans and other animals. But why is sleep so vital to our health? A UCLA-led team of scientists has made a major advance in answering this question and has shown for the first time that a dramatic change in the purpose of sleep occurs at the age of about 2-and-a-half.

Before that age, the brain grows very rapidly. During REM sleep, when vivid dreams occur, the young brain is busy building and strengthening synapses — the structures that connect neurons to one another and allow them to communicate.

“Don’t wake babies up during REM sleep — important work is being done in their brains as they sleep,” said senior study author Gina Poe, a UCLA professor of integrative biology and physiology who has conducted sleep research for more than 30 years.


After 2-and-a-half years, however, sleep’s primary purpose switches from brain building to brain maintenance and repair, a role it maintains for the rest of our lives, the scientists report Sept. 18 in the journal Science Advances. This transition, the researchers say, corresponds to changes in brain development.

All animals naturally experience a certain amount of neurological damage during waking hours, and the resulting debris, including damaged genes and proteins within neurons, can build up and cause brain disease. Sleep helps repair this damage and clear the debris — essentially decluttering the brain and taking out the trash that can lead to serious illness.

Nearly all of this brain repair occurs during sleep, according to senior author Van Savage, a UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and of computational medicine, and his colleagues.

“I was shocked how huge a change this is over a short period of time, and that this switch occurs when we’re so young,” Savage said. “It’s a transition that is analogous to when water freezes to ice.”

axw3555,,,"Quite possible. There are certain things that autism and ADHD cross on.

The big one is something called executive function. Basically, executive functions are a load of processes in your brain that let you go ""I want to do/achieve X"", then guide you to actually achieve it. Broadly speaking they cover things like inhibition, attention/focus, and working memory (I feel like I'm forgetting one, but that's the majority of the commonly referenced ones)

Inhibition is twofold. The first is the ability to inhibit your behaviour - the impulse to punch your boss or put your hand in the fire. The second is the ability to inhibit your reaction to input stimuli - so ignoring the banging from the building site across the street, the smell of the toast you burned earlier, etc. 

Attention and focus are names for the same thing, and they're exactly what you think they are - your ability to focus on doing things. Though it's not always a deficit (though it's more common), the other is a surplus. Someone with a deficit of the attention process makes it hard for you to stay focused, even if you're inhibiting the input responses, any new or changed input can draw you out of what you're doing. Surplus means you find it hard to break out of something. You get focused on it and have a hard time breaking it (though unlike ADHD, attentions surplus on its own doesn't have the same kind of issues in living a normal life, so it's not it's own condition AFAIK).

The last one is working memory. We all know about long term memory, short term memory, muscle memory etc. The one that the average guy on the street doesn't know so well is working memory. You could consider it ""super-short-term memory"". Basically, when you stand up and go ""I'm gonna goto the bathroom, make a coffee, put the dinner on and then come back in and read this"", you're putting it into working memory. 

Dysfunctions in executive functions tend to be components of other conditions. ADHD has a deficit in the process for focus, and can also have it in the behavioural inhibition process. Which is what makes it hard for them to focus on things and sometimes act out.

The classical ""stimming"" behaviour that many people picture with non-verbal autism is often an issue in the input inhibition process. They're getting overloaded by something they can't filter out. To a neurotypical, it's often something minor - a hoover, traffic, the compressor of a fridge - that they filtered out a few seconds after they walked into the room. But the autist can't ignore it, and in non-verbal kids they also can't articulate what's causing them problems. 

For me, I'm what a lot of people would call a ""high functioning autist"". In 90% of situations, I can camouflage. But I do have executive issues, mostly in the working memory and sometimes in the input inhibition stream, and a little of the ""attention surplus"" trait. I start out with the best intentions to clean the bathroom, or study, or eat, or whatever. But if I get distracted, my working memory probably hasn't held what I was doing, or even that I *was* doing something. 

An example from today - I was planning to empty the dishwasher. I was walking into the kitchen and the phone rang. It was a crap number (you know, ""we are performing a survey"" or ""your washing machine warranty has run out""), so I didn't even answer it, but that minor distraction and looking at the phone completely drove the dishwasher out of my head. 

Now, obviously, we all do that from time to time - walk into a room and go ""what was I doing?"", but for me it happens basically several times a day, every day.

My normal memory is fine, I can remember what I did yesterday, I can remember my 18th birthday, I can recall *heaps* of random stuff like the name of the Aztec god of war, the text of a good 70% of all magic cards, that kind of thing. But I'll entirely forget everything I plan to do. I literally have a whiteboard on my wall now that I right to-do on, which helps, except that I will also get up and forget that I was going to check the whiteboard.

Since these things foster a purpose in human life, does this have implications that suicide may be hard wired in us as well as an evolutionary factor?

Humans in particular have a long history of sacrifice and such as well that could be to disguise this needs as a higher purpose.

To give you some numbers, I got 10 organ offers a day on average in Sept. 2019 and 21 a day on average in 2020.  October was not quite as bad with an average increase of about 150% over the previous Oct.

Radboudumc researchers find defective gene that exacerbates corona

Researchers at the Radboudumc in Nijmegen have discovered a defect in the genetic code of a number of coronary patients that explains why some young people become seriously ill with the coronavirus. They hope that other critically ill young corona patients can be better treated with the new insights.

The researchers tracked down the role of the TLR7 gene when a Maastricht UMC + doctor noticed that two young brothers were seriously ill with covid-19 and needed to breathe. One of them died from the effects of the disease, the other recovered. That young people get so sick from corona is exceptional, most have only mild complaints.

""In such a case, you immediately ask yourself whether genetic factors play a role,"" says geneticist Alexander Hoischen of the Radboudumc. ""It could be a coincidence that two brothers became so seriously ill, but it is also possible that a congenital abnormality played a role.""

Essential gen

The research team mapped some of the brothers' genes and looked in particular at the genes that play a role in the immune system. A gene on the X chromosome soon appeared: TLR7. That gene helps in recognizing pathogens and activating the immune system. The two brothers were found to be missing some letters in the genetic code.

The team concluded that the TLR7 gene is apparently essential for detecting the coronavirus. Hoischen: ""It seems that the virus can just go on because the immune system does not receive a message that the virus has entered. That could be the reason for the serious course of the disease.""

Men are extra susceptible to the genetic code error. Women with two X chromosomes also have two copies of the TLR7 gene. Because men only have one, there is no second gene that can take over the role of the defective TLR7 as in women.

Two more brothers

During the study, the researchers unexpectedly came across two more seriously ill brothers under the age of 35 who had to breathe on the IC. They recovered from the disease. There was also something wrong with them with the TLR7 gene. ""This time we did not see a loss of letters, but a single typo,"" says Hoischen. ""The effect is the same because these brothers also produce too little TLR7.""

The team also investigated what exactly the gene in question does when activated. It then provides for the production of interferons, special proteins that are essential in the fight against viral infections. It is precisely in corona that they are important, says Cas van der Made, a doctor in training at the department of internal medicine. ""From the literature we know that this virus has tricks to reduce the production of interferons by immune cells.""

Experiments showed that the repellent cells of patients without a well-functioning TLR7 hardly reacted and no additional interferons were produced. The virus seemed to have free play.

The discovery by Raboudumc researchers could help treat other seriously ill corona patients. The substance interferon can be given to patients as therapy. It is currently being investigated whether this actually helps with the treatment.",1595657903,,fz69axp,False,t3_hxhxmh,t3_hxhxmh,1595716932,3003,False,science,t5_mouw

Wagamaga,  reward1,,"A study conducted by Hiroshima University researchers found that using Ultraviolet C light with a wavelength of 222 nanometers which is safer to use around humans effectively kills SARS-CoV-2 — the first research in the world to prove its efficacy against the virus that causes COVID-19.

Other studies involving 222 nm UVC, also known as Far-UVC, have so far only looked at its potency in eradicating seasonal coronaviruses that are structurally similar to the SARS-CoV-2 but not on the COVID-19-causing virus itself. A nanometer is equivalent to one billionth of a meter.

An in vitro experiment by HU researchers showed that 99.7% of the SARS-CoV-2 viral culture was killed after a 30-second exposure to 222 nm UVC irradiation at 0.1 mW/cm2. The study is published in the American Journal of Infection Control.

Tests were conducted using Ushio’s Care222TM krypton-chloride excimer lamp. A 100 microliter solution containing the virus (ca. 5 × 106 TCID50/mL) was spread onto a 9-centimeter sterile polystyrene plate. The researchers allowed it to dry in a biosafety cabinet at room temperature before placing the Far-UVC lamp 24 centimeters above the surface of the plates.

222 nm vs 254 nm UVC

A wavelength of 222 nm UVC cannot penetrate the outer, non-living layer of the human eye and skin so it won’t cause harm to the living cells beneath. This makes it a safer but equally potent alternative to the more damaging 254 nm UVC germicidal lamps increasingly used in disinfecting healthcare facilities

Wagamaga,  reward1,,"Prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to severe health problems in humans and other animals. But why is sleep so vital to our health? A UCLA-led team of scientists has made a major advance in answering this question and has shown for the first time that a dramatic change in the purpose of sleep occurs at the age of about 2-and-a-half.

Before that age, the brain grows very rapidly. During REM sleep, when vivid dreams occur, the young brain is busy building and strengthening synapses — the structures that connect neurons to one another and allow them to communicate.

“Don’t wake babies up during REM sleep — important work is being done in their brains as they sleep,” said senior study author Gina Poe, a UCLA professor of integrative biology and physiology who has conducted sleep research for more than 30 years.


After 2-and-a-half years, however, sleep’s primary purpose switches from brain building to brain maintenance and repair, a role it maintains for the rest of our lives, the scientists report Sept. 18 in the journal Science Advances. This transition, the researchers say, corresponds to changes in brain development.

All animals naturally experience a certain amount of neurological damage during waking hours, and the resulting debris, including damaged genes and proteins within neurons, can build up and cause brain disease. Sleep helps repair this damage and clear the debris — essentially decluttering the brain and taking out the trash that can lead to serious illness.

Nearly all of this brain repair occurs during sleep, according to senior author Van Savage, a UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and of computational medicine, and his colleagues.

“I was shocked how huge a change this is over a short period of time, and that this switch occurs when we’re so young,” Savage said. “It’s a transition that is analogous to when water freezes to ice.”

I work in organ transplant and the increase in organ offers since the lock down started has been overwhelming.  

To give you some numbers, I got 10 organ offers a day on average in Sept. 2019 and 21 a day on average in 2020.  October was not quite as bad with an average increase of about 150% over the previous Oct.  

Overall the number of organ offers increased 7% from April to the end of November this year over last.  We did have almost a moratorium on organ donors for about the first month as people came to terms with what to do and how best to operate with covid.  

We have run out of lung recipients a number of times with all the transplants we have been doing and one of my centers transplanted 5 hearts already this week.  

I know that the local OPO usually has about 200 organ donors a year and this year they are on schedule to have about 300.

Wagamaga,  reward1,,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Still incurable, it directly affects nearly one million people in Europe, and indirectly millions of family members as well as society as a whole. In recent years, the scientific community has suspected that the gut microbiota plays a role in the development of the disease. A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) in Switzerland, together with Italian colleagues from the National Research and Care Center for Alzheimer's and Psychiatric Diseases Fatebenefratelli in Brescia, University of Naples and the IRCCS SDN Research Center in Naples, confirm the correlation, in humans, between an imbalance in the gut microbiota and the development of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are at the origin of the neurodegenerative disorders characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Proteins produced by certain intestinal bacteria, identified in the blood of patients, could indeed modify the interaction between the immune and the nervous systems and trigger the disease. These results, to be discovered in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, make it possible to envisage new preventive strategies based on the modulation of the microbiota of people at risk.

The research laboratory of neurologist Giovanni Frisoni, director of the HUG Memory Centre and professor at the Department of Rehabilitation and Geriatrics of the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, has been working for several years now on the potential influence of the gut microbiota on the brain, and more particularly on neurodegenerative diseases. «We have already shown that the gut microbiota composition in patients with Alzheimer's disease was altered, compared to people who do not suffer from such disorders,» he explains. «Their microbiota has indeed a reduced microbial diversity, with an over-representation of certain bacteria and a strong decrease in other microbes. Furthermore, we have also discovered an association between an inflammatory phenomenon detected in the blood, certain intestinal bacteria and Alzheimer's disease; hence the hypothesis that we wanted to test here: could inflammation in the blood be a mediator between the microbiota and the brain?

I work in organ transplant and the increase in organ offers since the lock down started has been overwhelming.  

To give you some numbers, I got 10 organ offers a day on average in Sept. 2019 and 21 a day on average in 2020.  October was not quite as bad with an average increase of about 150% over the previous Oct.

Wrong. The problem is that the major supermarket players have artificially set the cost. They pay so little that the farmers cannot afford to pay their workers more.

Like trying to see a spectrum of colours from white, it is difficult to make decisions when you're trying to see everything at once because there are just so many perspectives which are equally valid, it dilutes your understanding of right and wrong and the worst part is not everyone sees it this way so you have an impossible job explaining yourself to some circles, and in unfortunate circumstances some people just think you're being a smartass.

From personal experience, I think while this ""wise reasoning"" opens up more perspective, it also makes decision making harder because sometimes when considering everything there is no ""right or wrong"".

I work in organ transplant and the increase in organ offers since the lock down started has been overwhelming.  

To give you some numbers, I got 10 organ offers a day on average in Sept. 2019 and 21 a day on average in 2020.  October was not quite as bad with an average increase of about 150% over the previous Oct.  

Overall the number of organ offers increased 7% from April to the end of November this year over last.  We did have almost a moratorium on organ donors for about the first month as people came to terms with what to do and how best to operate with covid.  

We have run out of lung recipients a number of times with all the transplants we have been doing and one of my centers transplanted 5 hearts already this week.  

I know that the local OPO usually has about 200 organ donors a year and this year they are on schedule to have about 300.  

So these findings are not surprising to me at all.  It seems that the study is covering a general trend over more time than just the lock down but the lock down seems to have increased the effect dramatically.

Once I do that I go back over it and use terms that define what really happened in very blunt terms. If the memory is too hard to do that then the therapist paraphrases the event in simple terms (so ""and then he took me into the shower, and he explained that this was normal, and I didn't know any better I was just X years old"" becomes ""this pedophile raped you""). 

It sounded so stupid at first and by the end of my first time doing it I was blubbering like a baby out of nowhere...like I hadn't felt that extreme amount of discomfort before let alone embraced it. By the end I felt like I was drained and exhausted....like my body actually ached. And then the next day was the first day that memory didn't pop into my head in months.

Wagamaga,  reward1,,"Pathological personality traits are associated with prejudicial views, according to new research published in Personality and Individual Differences. The findings indicate that people with calloused, deceitful, and manipulative interpersonal styles are more likely to endorse right-wing authoritarianism and express hostile attitudes towards marginalized groups.

“My interest in the relationship between pathological personality traits, such as those captured by psychopathy, and prejudicial tendencies originated from my experiences working with offenders in the Arizona correctional system prior to graduate school,” said study author Sandeep Roy, a clinical psychology doctoral candidate at the University of North Texas.

“I noticed offenders who were elevated in psychopathic propensities, as measured by the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare, 2003), frequently used racial epithets to denigrate me and other staff. When I began studying this personality disorder more in my graduate training, I noticed a paucity of literature relating psychopathy to prejudice.”

“Given the increase in hate-based violence in the last few years, I wanted to explore if certain personality traits traditionally studied in the realm of clinical psychology may be predictive of prejudice and provide empirical research on this understudied topic. Psychopathy is particularly relevant to prejudice given that facets of the disorder, such as callousness or lack of empathy, are predictive of prejudicial tendencies.”

Yes it is. 

Muscle mass and strength

Females in general have lower total [muscle mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_mass) than males, and also having lower muscle mass in comparison to total body mass;[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-34)  males convert more of their caloric intake into muscle and expendable  circulating energy reserves, while females tend to convert more into fat  deposits.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-35)  As a consequence, males are generally physically stronger than females.  While individual muscle fibers have similar strength between male and  female, males have more fibers as a result of their greater total muscle  mass.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-36)   Males remain stronger than females when adjusting for differences in  total body mass, due to the higher male muscle-mass to body-mass ratio.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-37) The greater muscle mass is reported to be due to a greater capacity for [muscular hypertrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hypertrophy) as a result of higher levels of circulating testosterone in males.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-38) 

Gross measures of body [strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_strength) suggest that women are approximately 50-60% as strong as men in the upper body, and 60-70% as strong in the lower body.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-39) One study of muscle strength in the [elbows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbows) and [knees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knees)—in 45 and older males and females—found the strength of females to range from 42 to 63% of male strength.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-40)  Another study found men to have significantly higher hand-grip strength  than women, even when comparing untrained men with female athletes.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-41) Differences in width of arm, thighs and calves appear during puberty.",1609388308,,ghkpt9w,False,t3_knhggm,t1_ghkovwz,1609392404,15,False,science,t5_mouw

Yes it is. 

Muscle mass and strength

Females in general have lower total [muscle mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_mass) than males, and also having lower muscle mass in comparison to total body mass;[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-34)  males convert more of their caloric intake into muscle and expendable  circulating energy reserves, while females tend to convert more into fat  deposits.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-35)  As a consequence, males are generally physically stronger than females.  While individual muscle fibers have similar strength between male and  female, males have more fibers as a result of their greater total muscle  mass.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-36)   Males remain stronger than females when adjusting for differences in  total body mass, due to the higher male muscle-mass to body-mass ratio.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-37) The greater muscle mass is reported to be due to a greater capacity for [muscular hypertrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hypertrophy) as a result of higher levels of circulating testosterone in males.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-38) 

Gross measures of body [strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_strength) suggest that women are approximately 50-60% as strong as men in the upper body, and 60-70% as strong in the lower body.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-39) One study of muscle strength in the [elbows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbows) and [knees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knees)—in 45 and older males and females—found the strength of females to range from 42 to 63% of male strength.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-40)  Another study found men to have significantly higher hand-grip strength  than women, even when comparing untrained men with female athletes.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology#cite_note-41) Differences in width of arm, thighs and calves appear during puberty.",1609388308,,ghkpt9w,False,t3_knhggm,t1_ghkovwz,1609392404,15,False,science,t5_mouw
