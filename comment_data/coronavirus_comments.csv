Bluest_waters,,,"TLDR: People who wear masks are still exposed to very small doses of the virus.

These doses may not be large enough to cause symptoms but they could still be large enough to induce an immune response. So by wearing a mask and getting very small viral doses, you may actually build up immunity to Covid 19. This is an acedemic opinion piece in the NEJM, so its not a study but like an hypothesis from a noted expert. NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the world. 

As I said in another comment the proper term for this process is called inoculation (medical professionals usually use the term 'variolation'). this is how small pox was kept in check. They would take some pus from the open wound of a small pox patient, put it on a pin head and poke the arms of those who didn't yet have it. It was just enough viral dose to provoke an immune response. George Washington did this with his troops and it was one of the key to winning the revolutionary war.

The WHO was afraid people would be selfish and buy out N95 respirators which are desperately needed in hospitals… so they created a narrative that ALL masks are worthless UNLESS you’re the one who is sick.

This is why you should never lie to the public. People sniffed contradiction in that statement from a mile away – if something allegedly works for doctors and nurses but somehow doesn’t work for you, then you have a confidence crisis brewing. And look at how polarizing mask usage is now.

These doses may not be large enough to cause symptoms but they could still be large enough to induce an immune response. So by wearing a mask and getting very small viral doses, you may actually build up immunity to Covid 19. This is an acedemic opinion piece in the NEJM, so its not a study but like an hypothesis from a noted expert. NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the world. 

As I said in another comment the proper term for this process is called inoculation (medical professionals usually use the term 'variolation'). this is how small pox was kept in check. They would take some pus from the open wound of a small pox patient, put it on a pin head and poke the arms of those who didn't yet have it. It was just enough viral dose to provoke an immune response. George Washington did this with his troops and it was one of the key to winning the revolutionary war.

The WHO was afraid people would be selfish and buy out N95 respirators which are desperately needed in hospitals… so they created a narrative that ALL masks are worthless UNLESS you’re the one who is sick.

They kept revising that narrative later (and some countries like Czech Republic had broken out of the groupthink making grassroots projects to make and distribute cloth masks nationwide) but the damage was done.

**Edit**: Holy crap, I went to sleep and this blew up. Some people are confusing what I said as I probably didn't make it clear as I was lazily typing a reply in bed. I don't believe that vaccines should be mandatory either, I was merely trying to point out her hypocrisy on whether or not someone tells her to do it, or she'll do it of her own volition. She CHOOSES not to wear a mask and I'm assuming she'll also choose not to take a vaccination if one were to come out. In no way though was I condoning using an untested vaccine or that I support a forced government mandate of said vaccine. 

Also, a couple have said that I must be lying because everywhere requires a mask. That's simply not true. Sure, there are signs posted everywhere that masks are required but very few establishments are actually enforcing it.

The spike protein contains amino acids that use an enzyme in the body, called furin, to dissolve cell coatings and allow the virus to enter.

I'm 90% sure that Newsweek COMPLETELY botched the interpretation of the data.

So if you pull up the tabs here you can click on ""Housing Insecurity"" you'll see that 9.1% of Americans are ""adults who are not current on rent or mortgage payments, or who have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time""

Okay, so how does that gel with this 35%?

Well, this 35% is ""Percentage of adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage where eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely""

So, lets parse that really quick.

&gt;Percentage of [adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage] **where** [eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely]""

Thats how you need to read it to properly understand it.  So of those behind on rent (9.1%), 35% think they'll get evicted or foreclosed.  So 3% of Americans are likely to be evicted or foreclosed in the next 2 months.

Still not sure I'm right?  [Okay, lets go to the questionnaire](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html)

It's in there if you click the PDF link.

Okay, scroll down to Question 40b and 40c.  Those are the ones asking if people are current.

&gt;Q40b Is this household currently caught up on rent payments? Select only one answer.

Okay, so thats for people renting.  Now we scroll down to 42a

&gt;&lt;If Q40b = 2 then display Q41a&gt;

So q41a only gets displayed if you answered no to 40b.

And what's q41a?

&gt;How likely is it that your household will have to leave this home or apartment within the next two months because of eviction?

So, they ONLY ask if you're going to get evicted if you are behind. So, yeah, that headline is total nonsense.  3% is the number.  I have no idea if thats normal or not, but yeah, that sucks for those 3%.  But obviously WAY better than 35%.",1608599362,,ggn8c70,False,t3_khscxs,t1_ggmuk7v,1608605928,162,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

periscope_artifact,,,"Text of article:
&gt; 
&gt; Scientists said the UK government’s drastic action to impose harsh restrictions over Christmas was fully justified by the extraordinary increase in infectiousness displayed by the new variant coronavirus — making it 70 per cent more transmissible than other strains in circulation.
&gt; 
&gt; The variant’s most remarkable feature is the number of mutations that have shaped it. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said 23 letters of the viral genetic code have changed, many of which are associated with the spike protein that the virus uses to get into human cells.
&gt; 
&gt; Coronaviruses do not usually mutate so quickly, typically accumulating about two genetic changes per month.
&gt; 
&gt; “This new variant is very concerning, and is unlike anything we have seen so far in the pandemic,” said Jeffrey Barrett, director of the Covid Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.
&gt; 
&gt; The increased infectivity of the variant is illustrated by the fact that, after appearing in Kent in late September, it was responsible for 28 per cent of infections in London by early November and in the week ending December 9 accounted for 62 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears to have increased the R value — the average number of people to whom someone with Covid-19 passes the infection — by 0.4, which makes the epidemic far harder to control.
&gt; 
&gt; “These reports on the transmissibility of the new variant are even more depressing than I had anticipated,” said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia.
&gt; 
&gt; “An increase in R of 0.4 or greater is extremely bad news. During the national lockdown in November the best we could achieve was an R value of somewhere between 0.8 and 1.0 around the UK,” said Prof Hunter. “What this means is that even if we went back to the lockdown it would still not be enough to bring the R value down to less than 1.0.”
&gt; 
&gt; But Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, rejected a suggestion at the Downing Street press conference that this was the worst moment so far in the battle against Covid-19. “This is not the worst moment of the epidemic,” he said. “We have a vaccine being rolled out. There is the prospect in the medium term future that things could be a lot brighter.”
&gt; 
&gt; Boris Johnson told the press conference that 350,000 people were given a first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the first two weeks of the programme. Vaccination rates will increase very quickly in the new year if the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approves the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine by the end of December, as many observers expect.
&gt; 
&gt; Daniel Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London said the emergence of the new variant “greatly strengthens the case for all to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The vaccines induce neutralising antibodies to several parts of spike and most of these would be unchanged by the mutations, so the vaccines will still work.”
&gt; 
&gt; Scientists at the government’s Porton Down microbiology labs and elsewhere are working hard to understand whether the mutations affect the severity of disease as well as transmissibility. Preliminary indications suggest that it does not have a significant impact on the development of Covid-19 symptoms.
&gt; 
&gt; François Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, told the FT the new variant was likely to have evolved while the virus was infecting a patient with a severely suppressed immune system.
&gt; 
&gt; “This can lead to pretty fast evolution and it probably jumped back into the population,” he said. “I don't think any of the mutations in isolation are concerning. I'd be very surprised if it led to more severe disease.”
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s also not a strain that should be able to escape protection provided by immunisation from the current vaccines or prior infection,” Prof Balloux added. “The current vaccines are still expected to offer adequate protection against this strain.”",1608486659,,gghzl9t,True,t3_kgya4i,t1_gghyclf,1608505115,139,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Pinewood74,,,"Reposting my comment on top comment for more visibility. 

I'm 90% sure that Newsweek COMPLETELY botched the interpretation of the data.

So if you pull up the tabs here you can click on ""Housing Insecurity"" you'll see that 9.1% of Americans are ""adults who are not current on rent or mortgage payments, or who have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time""

Okay, so how does that gel with this 35%?

Well, this 35% is ""Percentage of adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage where eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely""

So, lets parse that really quick.

&gt;Percentage of [adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage] **where** [eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely]""

Thats how you need to read it to properly understand it.  So of those behind on rent (9.1%), 35% think they'll get evicted or foreclosed.  So 3% of Americans are likely to be evicted or foreclosed in the next 2 months.

Still not sure I'm right?  [Okay, lets go to the questionnaire](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html)

It's in there if you click the PDF link.

Okay, scroll down to Question 40b and 40c.  Those are the ones asking if people are current.

&gt;Q40b Is this household currently caught up on rent payments? Select only one answer.

Okay, so thats for people renting.  Now we scroll down to 42a

&gt;&lt;If Q40b = 2 then display Q41a&gt;

So q41a only gets displayed if you answered no to 40b.

And what's q41a?

&gt;How likely is it that your household will have to leave this home or apartment within the next two months because of eviction?

So, they ONLY ask if you're going to get evicted if you are behind. So, yeah, that headline is total nonsense.  3% is the number.  I have no idea if thats normal or not, but yeah, that sucks for those 3%.  But obviously WAY better than 35%.",1608599362,,ggn8c70,False,t3_khscxs,t1_ggmuk7v,1608605928,162,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

periscope_artifact,,,"Text of article:
&gt; 
&gt; Scientists said the UK government’s drastic action to impose harsh restrictions over Christmas was fully justified by the extraordinary increase in infectiousness displayed by the new variant coronavirus — making it 70 per cent more transmissible than other strains in circulation.
&gt; 
&gt; The variant’s most remarkable feature is the number of mutations that have shaped it. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said 23 letters of the viral genetic code have changed, many of which are associated with the spike protein that the virus uses to get into human cells.
&gt; 
&gt; Coronaviruses do not usually mutate so quickly, typically accumulating about two genetic changes per month.
&gt; 
&gt; “This new variant is very concerning, and is unlike anything we have seen so far in the pandemic,” said Jeffrey Barrett, director of the Covid Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.
&gt; 
&gt; The increased infectivity of the variant is illustrated by the fact that, after appearing in Kent in late September, it was responsible for 28 per cent of infections in London by early November and in the week ending December 9 accounted for 62 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears to have increased the R value — the average number of people to whom someone with Covid-19 passes the infection — by 0.4, which makes the epidemic far harder to control.
&gt; 
&gt; “These reports on the transmissibility of the new variant are even more depressing than I had anticipated,” said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia.
&gt; 
&gt; “An increase in R of 0.4 or greater is extremely bad news. During the national lockdown in November the best we could achieve was an R value of somewhere between 0.8 and 1.0 around the UK,” said Prof Hunter. “What this means is that even if we went back to the lockdown it would still not be enough to bring the R value down to less than 1.0.”
&gt; 
&gt; But Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, rejected a suggestion at the Downing Street press conference that this was the worst moment so far in the battle against Covid-19. “This is not the worst moment of the epidemic,” he said. “We have a vaccine being rolled out. There is the prospect in the medium term future that things could be a lot brighter.”
&gt; 
&gt; Boris Johnson told the press conference that 350,000 people were given a first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the first two weeks of the programme. Vaccination rates will increase very quickly in the new year if the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approves the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine by the end of December, as many observers expect.
&gt; 
&gt; Daniel Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London said the emergence of the new variant “greatly strengthens the case for all to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The vaccines induce neutralising antibodies to several parts of spike and most of these would be unchanged by the mutations, so the vaccines will still work.”
&gt; 
&gt; Scientists at the government’s Porton Down microbiology labs and elsewhere are working hard to understand whether the mutations affect the severity of disease as well as transmissibility. Preliminary indications suggest that it does not have a significant impact on the development of Covid-19 symptoms.
&gt; 
&gt; François Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, told the FT the new variant was likely to have evolved while the virus was infecting a patient with a severely suppressed immune system.
&gt; 
&gt; “This can lead to pretty fast evolution and it probably jumped back into the population,” he said. “I don't think any of the mutations in isolation are concerning. I'd be very surprised if it led to more severe disease.”
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s also not a strain that should be able to escape protection provided by immunisation from the current vaccines or prior infection,” Prof Balloux added. “The current vaccines are still expected to offer adequate protection against this strain.”",1608486659,,gghzl9t,True,t3_kgya4i,t1_gghyclf,1608505115,139,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Pinewood74,,,"Reposting my comment on top comment for more visibility. 

I'm 90% sure that Newsweek COMPLETELY botched the interpretation of the data.

So if you pull up the tabs here you can click on ""Housing Insecurity"" you'll see that 9.1% of Americans are ""adults who are not current on rent or mortgage payments, or who have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time""

Okay, so how does that gel with this 35%?

Well, this 35% is ""Percentage of adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage where eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely""

So, lets parse that really quick.

&gt;Percentage of [adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage] **where** [eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely]""

Thats how you need to read it to properly understand it.  So of those behind on rent (9.1%), 35% think they'll get evicted or foreclosed.  So 3% of Americans are likely to be evicted or foreclosed in the next 2 months.

Still not sure I'm right?  [Okay, lets go to the questionnaire](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html)

It's in there if you click the PDF link.

Okay, scroll down to Question 40b and 40c.  Those are the ones asking if people are current.

&gt;Q40b Is this household currently caught up on rent payments? Select only one answer.

Okay, so thats for people renting.  Now we scroll down to 42a

&gt;&lt;If Q40b = 2 then display Q41a&gt;

So q41a only gets displayed if you answered no to 40b.

And what's q41a?

&gt;How likely is it that your household will have to leave this home or apartment within the next two months because of eviction?

So, they ONLY ask if you're going to get evicted if you are behind. So, yeah, that headline is total nonsense.  3% is the number.  I have no idea if thats normal or not, but yeah, that sucks for those 3%.  But obviously WAY better than 35%.",1608599362,,ggn8c70,False,t3_khscxs,t1_ggmuk7v,1608605928,162,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Once again it was just a bunch of random, uneducated people with a strong pessimistic bias creating a panic over something that really, really isn't a big deal.

This new variant is more contagious. It doesn't seem to have changed lethality or severity, but again, we don't know that yet. But this isn't the first, second, or third time the virus mutated. It's done that hundreds of times now, that's something viruses do very, very often.

Maybe it being more contagious would have been really, really scary back in May, but considering that the United States, Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom- and I believe Australia and New Zealand- have begun aggressive vaccination campaigns with very strong focuses on the people who are most likely to die from this, it's really not a huge deal. If a healthy twenty year old with no comorbidities is more likely to get this, I'm not particularly alarmed.

Pinewood74,,,"Reposting my comment on top comment for more visibility. 

I'm 90% sure that Newsweek COMPLETELY botched the interpretation of the data.

So if you pull up the tabs here you can click on ""Housing Insecurity"" you'll see that 9.1% of Americans are ""adults who are not current on rent or mortgage payments, or who have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time""

Okay, so how does that gel with this 35%?

Well, this 35% is ""Percentage of adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage where eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely""

So, lets parse that really quick.

&gt;Percentage of [adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage] **where** [eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely]""

Thats how you need to read it to properly understand it.  So of those behind on rent (9.1%), 35% think they'll get evicted or foreclosed.  So 3% of Americans are likely to be evicted or foreclosed in the next 2 months.

Still not sure I'm right?  [Okay, lets go to the questionnaire](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html)

It's in there if you click the PDF link.

Okay, scroll down to Question 40b and 40c.  Those are the ones asking if people are current.

&gt;Q40b Is this household currently caught up on rent payments? Select only one answer.

Okay, so thats for people renting.  Now we scroll down to 42a

&gt;&lt;If Q40b = 2 then display Q41a&gt;

So q41a only gets displayed if you answered no to 40b.

And what's q41a?

&gt;How likely is it that your household will have to leave this home or apartment within the next two months because of eviction?

So, they ONLY ask if you're going to get evicted if you are behind. So, yeah, that headline is total nonsense.  3% is the number.  I have no idea if thats normal or not, but yeah, that sucks for those 3%.  But obviously WAY better than 35%.",1608599362,,ggn8c70,False,t3_khscxs,t1_ggmuk7v,1608605928,162,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Once again it was just a bunch of random, uneducated people with a strong pessimistic bias creating a panic over something that really, really isn't a big deal.

This new variant is more contagious. It doesn't seem to have changed lethality or severity, but again, we don't know that yet. But this isn't the first, second, or third time the virus mutated. It's done that hundreds of times now, that's something viruses do very, very often.

Maybe it being more contagious would have been really, really scary back in May, but considering that the United States, Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom- and I believe Australia and New Zealand- have begun aggressive vaccination campaigns with very strong focuses on the people who are most likely to die from this, it's really not a huge deal. If a healthy twenty year old with no comorbidities is more likely to get this, I'm not particularly alarmed. I understand there's the possibility of side effects years from now, but in the discussion of hospitalization and death counts, the matter of something being more contagious isn't extremely relevant in a time where we're rapidly vaccinating millions and millions of people every week.",1608593509,,ggmxp7a,False,t3_khsgsi,t1_ggmvlsm,1608600432,105,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

If EVERYTHING else about the new variant is the same except for how easily it spreads, that will still spell major trouble.  
If it rips through the world population quickly enough, it could dramatically drive an increase of hospitalized cases.

Trying to work in the hospital right now is like trying to drink from a water hose. The inpatient team has 96 patients right now. 27 admits are from last night. Two doctors plus an NP are out with Covid so the team has 1 NP and 2 doctors.  For all those patients.  I am in the ER. We are boarding 18 patients.  It’s A mess. The hallways are lined with trash cans for all our discarded gloves and some PPE.  We’ve give up even trying to wear yellow gowns.  N95’s have to be checked out for administration and the closets and flat areas are littered with paper bags adorned with scribbles. “Chang #4”, This is Dr Chang’s N95 in the bag, it’s his 4th day wearing it. We have pizza in the staff room, I’m not sure if the hospital got it or the Public did, to whomever. Thank you. It means we don’t have to leave the ER to go get food. There  a code blue ( which we call as a number) and a code white (violent patient). I’ve got two prison patients and they must be  watched by law enforcement adding to the body count in the ER. Computers are in short supply and we hunker over them guarding them like a hungry dog lording over its food bowl. The ER is a living breathing animal right now. Hot from all the people shoved in here. Lumbering toward catastrophic failure held together by a health care worker Bondo created from traveling nurses and locums. A mixture of panic and resignation.  There’s not much we can do, and although we care there is very little caring going on. 

The hospital lobby though is a serene other word. The barista is making pumpkin spice lattes, oblivious to what’s behind the badge locked doors.  There’s a Christmas tree. There’s posters calling us heroes.  Occasionally there is the tinkle of bells overhead, that’s a baby being born, and the visitors smile. We are erased from our own hospital, gas lit by administration and a public that can not see what I see. A patient told me today, while  gasping With a nasal cannula, that he doesn’t have Covid.  That this is just the bronchitis he gets every winter. That this is all designed to make the hospital money. And I want to scream at him. I want to drag him by his Foley  down the halls, through the ICU, and into the morgue. To see the world I live in.

Pinewood74,,,"I'm 90% sure that Newsweek COMPLETELY botched the interpretation of the data.

So if you pull up the tabs here you can click on ""Housing Insecurity"" you'll see that 9.1% of Americans are ""adults who are not current on rent or mortgage payments, or who have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time""

Okay, so how does that gel with this 35%?

Well, this 35% is ""Percentage of adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage where eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely""

So, lets parse that really quick.

&gt;Percentage of [adults living in households not current on rent or mortgage] **where** [eviction or foreclosure in the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely]""

Thats how you need to read it to properly understand it.  So of those behind on rent (9.1%), 35% think they'll get evicted or foreclosed.  So 3% of Americans are likely to be evicted or foreclosed in the next 2 months.

Still not sure I'm right?  [Okay, lets go to the questionnaire](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html)

It's in there if you click the PDF link.

Okay, scroll down to Question 40b and 40c.  Those are the ones asking if people are current.

&gt;Q40b Is this household currently caught up on rent payments? Select only one answer.

Okay, so thats for people renting.  Now we scroll down to 42a

&gt;&lt;If Q40b = 2 then display Q41a&gt;

So q41a only gets displayed if you answered no to 40b.

And what's q41a?

&gt;How likely is it that your household will have to leave this home or apartment within the next two months because of eviction?

So, they ONLY ask if you're going to get evicted if you are behind. So, yeah, that headline is total nonsense.  3% is the number.  I have no idea if thats normal or not, but yeah, that sucks for those 3%.  But obviously WAY better than 35%.",1608598820,,ggn7dnt,False,t3_khscxs,t1_ggmwmot,1608605436,56,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Trying to work in the hospital right now is like trying to drink from a water hose. The inpatient team has 96 patients right now. 27 admits are from last night. Two doctors plus an NP are out with Covid so the team has 1 NP and 2 doctors.  For all those patients.  I am in the ER. We are boarding 18 patients.  It’s A mess. The hallways are lined with trash cans for all our discarded gloves and some PPE.  We’ve give up even trying to wear yellow gowns.  N95’s have to be checked out for administration and the closets and flat areas are littered with paper bags adorned with scribbles. “Chang #4”, This is Dr Chang’s N95 in the bag, it’s his 4th day wearing it. We have pizza in the staff room, I’m not sure if the hospital got it or the Public did, to whomever. Thank you. It means we don’t have to leave the ER to go get food. There  a code blue ( which we call as a number) and a code white (violent patient). I’ve got two prison patients and they must be  watched by law enforcement adding to the body count in the ER. Computers are in short supply and we hunker over them guarding them like a hungry dog lording over its food bowl. The ER is a living breathing animal right now. Hot from all the people shoved in here. Lumbering toward catastrophic failure held together by a health care worker Bondo created from traveling nurses and locums. A mixture of panic and resignation.  There’s not much we can do, and although we care there is very little caring going on. 

The hospital lobby though is a serene other word. The barista is making pumpkin spice lattes, oblivious to what’s behind the badge locked doors.  There’s a Christmas tree. There’s posters calling us heroes.  Occasionally there is the tinkle of bells overhead, that’s a baby being born, and the visitors smile. We are erased from our own hospital, gas lit by administration and a public that can not see what I see. A patient told me today, while  gasping With a nasal cannula, that he doesn’t have Covid.  That this is just the bronchitis he gets every winter. That this is all designed to make the hospital money. And I want to scream at him. I want to drag him by his Foley  down the halls, through the ICU, and into the morgue. To see the world I live in.

Two doctors plus an NP are out with Covid so the team has 1 NP and 2 doctors.  For all those patients.  I am in the ER. We are boarding 18 patients.  It’s A mess. The hallways are lined with trash cans for all our discarded gloves and some PPE.  We’ve give up even trying to wear yellow gowns.  N95’s have to be checked out for administration and the closets and flat areas are littered with paper bags adorned with scribbles. “Chang #4”, This is Dr Chang’s N95 in the bag, it’s his 4th day wearing it. We have pizza in the staff room, I’m not sure if the hospital got it or the Public did, to whomever. Thank you. It means we don’t have to leave the ER to go get food. There  a code blue ( which we call as a number) and a code white (violent patient). I’ve got two prison patients and they must be  watched by law enforcement adding to the body count in the ER. Computers are in short supply and we hunker over them guarding them like a hungry dog lording over its food bowl. The ER is a living breathing animal right now. Hot from all the people shoved in here. Lumbering toward catastrophic failure held together by a health care worker Bondo created from traveling nurses and locums.

The hospital lobby though is a serene other word. The barista is making pumpkin spice lattes, oblivious to what’s behind the badge locked doors.  There’s a Christmas tree. There’s posters calling us heroes.  Occasionally there is the tinkle of bells overhead, that’s a baby being born, and the visitors smile. We are erased from our own hospital, gas lit by administration and a public that can not see what I see. A patient told me today, while  gasping With a nasal cannula, that he doesn’t have Covid.  That this is just the bronchitis he gets every winter. That this is all designed to make the hospital money. And I want to scream at him.

That is why residency and internship was created.  With the vast amount of oversight that it requires. Along the way there are both written tests and actual hands on test to determine proficiency. At many times NP’s asserted that they were just as good as physicians. Medical schools took them up on this and just asked them to take the same tests as physicians. It was an abject failure. Contrast this with DO’s which asserted they were equal to MD’s. They took the medical schools up on the offer of equivalency, passed the tests and were accepted into the fold as physicians.  

I’ve worked with good and bad NP’s and physicians.  But they are not the same and NP’s do not get to claim the mantle of being the only ones who care. It’s a disparagement of my profession and the time and love I give to my patients.
