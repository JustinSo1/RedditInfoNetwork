Sears is the exact same story.

In a hyper capitalist sense there's nothing wrong with this.  If the reputation is worth more than the cost of buying the company, you buy the company and liquidate the reputation.  From the standpoint of honorable business though, it's a big scam.

Even with interest rates down, a loan of that size could require $4 to $5 million in annual interest payments.

Trying to sell DC Hotel in 2019 for $500M

&gt; What the Trumps lack in style, they make up for in ambition. Hence the [reported $500 million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-organization-exploring-sale-of-marquee-washington-hotel-11572019874) they were hoping to fetch for the hotel. If that had actually happened, they could have paid off the $170 million Deutsche Bank loan, and the president would have walked away with $256 million in cash 

&amp;#x200B;

Offers coming in under $200M

&gt; Friedman admitted that he didn’t think his bid for the property would be successful. The problem: He figured Trump’s hotel should be valued similarly to the Mayflower Hotel, which has 581 rooms and which, he said, went for $175 million. He was skeptical that the Trump family would sell for something like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Negotiating with Deutche during covid

&gt;No surprise, then, that the Trump Organization [reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/business/economy/coronavirus-trump-company-finances.html) took steps in that direction in late March, reaching out to Deutsche Bank, which holds the loans on both the D.C. hotel and the Miami golf resort.  
&gt;  
&gt;That put Deutsche Bank in an awkward position. If it gave Trump a break on his loans, it would be doing a financial favor to the president of the United States, whose administration happened to be simultaneously pursuing an investigation of the bank. If Deutsche Bank refused to work with Trump and instead left him in a vulnerable position, then it could risk retaliation by the president.

&amp;#x200B;

He would have been better off divesting from his business and putting the money in the S&amp;P

&gt; with all that money appreciating in the broader market rather than diminishing in his assortment of COVID-affected properties, President Trump would be an estimated $800 million richer today.",1600445589,,g5pqn34,False,t3_iv6ucq,t3_iv6ucq,1600507706,82,False,business,t5_2qgzg

Sears is the exact same story.

In a hyper capitalist sense there's nothing wrong with this.  If the reputation is worth more than the cost of buying the company, you buy the company and liquidate the reputation.  From the standpoint of honorable business though, it's a big scam.

&amp;#x200B;

Struggling to make mortgage payments in boom times

&gt; The situation appears to be worse at the D.C. hotel. The Trump Organization had a $170 million mortgage against that property. Even with interest rates down, a loan of that size could require $4 to $5 million in annual interest payments. The property seemed to be struggling to produce enough profit to cover its interest in boom times. Amidst the coronavirus crisis, it’s probably a safe bet that the place is losing money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to sell DC Hotel in 2019 for $500M

&gt; What the Trumps lack in style, they make up for in ambition. Hence the [reported $500 million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-organization-exploring-sale-of-marquee-washington-hotel-11572019874) they were hoping to fetch for the hotel. If that had actually happened, they could have paid off the $170 million Deutsche Bank loan, and the president would have walked away with $256 million in cash 

&amp;#x200B;

Offers coming in under $200M

&gt; Friedman admitted that he didn’t think his bid for the property would be successful. The problem: He figured Trump’s hotel should be valued similarly to the Mayflower Hotel, which has 581 rooms and which, he said, went for $175 million. He was skeptical that the Trump family would sell for something like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Negotiating with Deutche during covid

&gt;No surprise, then, that the Trump Organization [reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/business/economy/coronavirus-trump-company-finances.html) took steps in that direction in late March, reaching out to Deutsche Bank, which holds the loans on both the D.C. hotel and the Miami golf resort.  
&gt;  
&gt;That put Deutsche Bank in an awkward position. If it gave Trump a break on his loans, it would be doing a financial favor to the president of the United States, whose administration happened to be simultaneously pursuing an investigation of the bank. If Deutsche Bank refused to work with Trump and instead left him in a vulnerable position, then it could risk retaliation by the president.

&amp;#x200B;

He would have been better off divesting from his business and putting the money in the S&amp;P
