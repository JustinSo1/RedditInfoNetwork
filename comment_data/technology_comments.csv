Quick recap for those lucky enough to not need a subscription to /r/qanoncasualties, these people believe:

1. Trump is waging a shadow ""largest military operation in history"" against a global cabal.

2. There are tens of thousands of members of this cabal, mostly Democrats and celebrities.

3. These people *rape and eat thousands of innocent children* regularly.

4. An anonymous government insider (QAnon) has been feeding the public poorly-coded messages via 4chan (at first), 8chan, and 8kun.

5. Many of these cabalites (including Hillary and others) are already either in Guantanamo Bay or executed.

The result of these ""facts"" that these Qult people **want to see happen**:

1. Trump declares martial law.

2. These thousands of Democrats will be pushed through military tribunals. 

3. They will be systematically executed in public and on TV.

4. The Qultists will be awarded for their ""digital war"" and will help rebuild and educate the Americans who are left after the mass killings.


I'm sure you can see why this conspiracy theory isnt as harmless as flat earthers or bigfoot people. If you *truly believe* these things are true, there are very violent natural conclusions to arrive at.


Not to mention that the eventual result of people driving into the QAnon shit is that these people end up isolating themselves from friends and family, and usually only going deeper.

AxoKoxA,,,"A China-based Zoom executive was charged with coordinating with the Chinese government to shut down Zoom meetings in the United States and elsewhere on a host of religious and political topics, including the commemoration of the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Xinjiang Jin, also known as Julien Jin, worked at the behest of China's Ministry of Public Security, according to a complaint unsealed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on Friday. The Justice Department said he was charged with “conspiracy to commit interstate harassment and unlawful conspiracy to transfer a means of identification” as he worked as Zoom’s “primary liaison with PRC law enforcement and intelligence services.” Jin, who was based in China, is wanted by the FBI, though it is unlikely he would be sent over to the U.S. If tried and convicted, however, he faces up to 10 years in prison.

“He regularly responded to requests from the PRC government for information and to terminate video meetings hosted on Company-1’s [Zoom’s] video communications platform,” the Justice Department said. “Jin’s duties included providing information to the PRC government about Company-1’s users and meetings, and in some cases he provided information — such as Internet Protocol addresses, names, and email addresses — of users located outside of the PRC. Jin was also responsible for proactively monitoring Company-1’s video communications platform for what the PRC government considers to be ‘illegal’ meetings to discuss political and religious subjects unacceptable to the Chinese Communist Party.”

The Justice Department added that “between January 2019 to the present, Jin and others conspired to use Company-1’s systems in the United States to censor the political and religious speech of individuals located in the United States and around the world at the direction ... of officials of the PRC government” and that “Jin and others terminated at least four video meetings hosted on Company-1’s networks commemorating the thirty-first anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, most of which were organized and attended by U.S.-based participants, such as dissidents who had participated in and survived the 1989 protests.”

The Tiananmen Square protests took place in Beijing and across China in 1989, with reformers and students calling upon the ruling Communist Party to address corruption and inflation while demanding democracy and freedoms of speech and press, with 1 million or more people assembling in the square at the zenith. The Chinese government declared martial law, and tens of thousands of troops killed thousands during a crackdown, according to reporters and Western diplomats. Discussion of the crackdown is heavily suppressed in China.

No company with significant business interests in China is immune from the coercive power of the Chinese Communist Party,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said. “The Chinese Communist Party will use those within its reach to sap the tree of liberty, stifling free speech in China, the United States and elsewhere about the Party’s repression of the Chinese people.”

“Zoom is dedicated to the free and open exchange of ideas and supports the U.S. Government’s commitment to protect American interests from foreign influence ... We have also been conducting a thorough internal investigation,” a Zoom spokesperson told the Washington Examiner, adding that “at this stage in our investigation, and with the exception of user data for fewer than ten individual users, we do not believe this former employee or any other Zoom employee provided the Chinese government with user data of non-China-based users” and that “we terminated this individual’s employment for violating company policies.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray said, “The FBI remains committed to protecting the exercise of free speech for all Americans” and “that freedom was directly infringed upon by the pernicious activities of Communist China’s Intelligence Services, in support of a regime that neither reflects nor upholds our democratic values.”

The Justice Department noted that “Jin’s co-conspirators created fake email accounts and Company-1 accounts in the names of others, including PRC political dissidents, to fabricate evidence that the hosts and participants ... were supporting terrorist organizations, inciting violence, or distributing child pornography” and “Jin used the complaints as evidence to persuade Company-1 executives based in the United States to terminate meetings and suspend or terminate the user accounts.” The Chinese government also “took advantage of information provided by Jin to retaliate against and intimidate participants residing in the PRC, or PRC-based family members of meeting participants,"" according to the DOJ.

FBI Special Agent Joseph Hugdahl helped author the 47-page complaint filed with the Brooklyn court, writing, “The PRC government’s national security and law enforcement agencies regard political dissent as a national security threat and routinely monitor and actively censor political speech inconsistent with CCP-approved political viewpoints.”

The Justice Department “extended their thanks and appreciation to Company-1 for its cooperation in the government’s ongoing investigation.”

A Zoom blog post on Friday stated that “in September 2019, the Chinese government turned off our service in China” and “as we worked to resolve the shutdown, China requested that Zoom confirm it would comply with Chinese law, including designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests and transferring China-based user data housed in the United States to a data center in China.” Zoom said that “in October 2019, Zoom appointed the now-former employee to serve as the government contact in China.”

Zoom also said that “with the goal of restoring our service, Zoom personnel, including our CEO, met in China with government authorities in October 2019."" The company said that its “rectification plan” contained “information about actions Zoom previously took to adhere to Chinese law, including shutting down certain types of political, religious, and sexually explicit meetings” and said, “The Chinese government ultimately unblocked Zoom on November 17, 2019.”

The company said that “no meeting content will ever be routed through our mainland China data center (one of 19 co-located data centers routing traffic) unless the meeting includes a participant from China."" Another Zoom statement in June that was updated on Friday said that “going forward, Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China.”",1608545050,,ggko0xy,False,t3_kha9go,t1_ggkdvnk,1608554296,47,False,technology,t5_2qh16

Myte342,,,"We've had this issue long before facial recognition technology. People have been full-on arrested while an officer has a picture of their suspect that looks absolutely nothing like the person and yet they continue on with the arrest anyway. The reason being if they get it wrong it's no skin off their backs. They don't face any meaningful punishment for ruining people's lives so why should they care?

There wad a news story not long ago where officers used Photoshop to edit people's pictures to make them look more like the suspect they were looking for. So now when they show that picture among other pictures in lineup to a witmess they're more likely to pick that person's picture because they've edited it. And it's not even small things they edit: they will take someone's picture and put full facial tattoos that match what the witness says the suspect had onto people who have no tattoos at all let alone a face tattoo.

As with most stories of this type we don't have a technology issue where the technology available to officers got it wrong... We have an officer issue qhere the officers don't care if they get it wrong or they will purposely get it wrong just to keep the day moving so they can move on to something else. Again they face no meaningful punishment so there's no reason for them to care.

And here's an example of what I mean when I say they face no meaningful punishment. Story from a few years back where a kid was trying to pay for something in a convenience store with a slightly damaged $5 bill. The cashier wouldn't accept it and there was an off-duty plainclothes cop behind the kid. The cop got impatient and ordered the kid to leave the store so he could pay with his stuff and get on with his day. As the kid is leaving he is still expressing his desire to purchase the items and the officer grabs him from behind throws him to the ground and arrests him for trespassing. While the kid is handcuffed face down on the concrete the cops slams his face into the concrete completely messing hin up and causing massive medical bills to reconstruct his face.

After 7 years the kid finally wins his lawsuit but he only barely wins enough to cover his medical bills. The officer was actually found in violation of Department policy and punished. Great story right? Except the officers punishment was 5 days unpaid suspension... which he could schedule at the officer's discretion so he can take every Monday off for a month and a half to get three day weekends and spread the impact of the financial damage he would take while better enjoying his time off

Worse yet he appealed to his Union and got even that punishment removed so in the end he didn't actually face any punishment at all.

And even worse than that he was on paid suspension (meaning a paid vacation...) during much of this time and attended Court sessions during this that count as overtime because they weren't a part of his regularly scheduled work. So in the end he actually profited from smashing a handcuffed kids face into the concrete. And he is still working as a cop last I checked...

That is what I mean when I say cops don't face actual consequences for their actions for messing up someone's life.",1609191016,,ghbs1r7,False,t3_klxcrm,t1_ghbmk8t,1609193029,34,False,technology,t5_2qh16

In fact, you could do it if you sat down and learned how to use the ArcGIS software.

The 'tech illiterate' thing everyone keeps talking about is when the State of Florida accused her of hacking into a government system to send out a mass SMS message. She stated she wasn't tech literate enough to do that - what she meant is that she doesn't know nearly enough networking/information security/software development to 'hack' things in the sense the public thinks about hacking. She likely knows barely more than a layman in those fields because working on GIS data analysis doesn't require any of that... although some software development skill is good to have for python scripting.

All the same, she used her skills and technology to fight what she felt is government corruption. And has become such a threat that the governor had her house raided.

bboyjkang,,,"&gt;**messing with data**

lol it was pretty obvious:

&gt; In March, when the Miami Herald sought information from the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner’s Office about COVID-19 deaths, attorneys for the state health department moved to block the records from becoming public.
&gt;     
&gt; When the Tampa Bay Times found medical examiner data didn’t match the state’s records, the **state ordered medical examiners not to release the numbers.**
 
`miamiherald/com/news/coronavirus/article242050696.html`

&gt; **The Miami Herald reported last week that Florida refused for weeks to release data** on COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, even as many other states did so.
&gt; 
&gt; ""[The state health department]'s public data are incomplete, sometimes changed without explanation, and have had information removed following questions from reporters,"" the Herald reports.

`npr/org/2020/06/14/876584284/fired-florida-data-scientist-launches-a-coronavirus-dashboard-of-her-own`

&gt; **Officials in Florida did not respond to repeated requests** for comment about why the state isn’t following federal guidelines.

`washingtonpost/com/investigations/cdc-wants-states-to-count-probable-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths-but-most-arent-doing-it/2020/06/07/4aac9a58-9d0a-11ea-b60c-3be060a4f8e1_story.html`

&gt; **Unlike some other states, Florida does not count anyone who has not been tested but that a doctor determined was a “probable” case of COVID-19.**
&gt; 
&gt; This has the potential to produce an undercount in total cases, hospitalizations and COVID-related deaths.

`miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243195161.html`

&gt; Initially Florida began calculating the “positivity rate” by dividing positive tests on a given day by total test results on the same day.
&gt; 
&gt; **But the state then shifted and began dividing first-time positive individuals by total tests.**
&gt; 
&gt; The first-time group is smaller, since people who test positive are often later retested multiple times to see if they have shed the disease.
&gt; 
&gt; That change would lead to a lowering of the positivity rate.

`miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243195161.html`

&gt; **Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, finds Jones' dashboard to be more comprehensive than the state's.**
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's some data on there that either wasn't on the Florida COVID-19 DOH dashboard or was available and maybe wasn't presented in the same way that it's being presented now ...
&gt; 
&gt; You're just getting a bigger picture of what's going on,"" Prins says.
&gt; 
&gt; **She also notes that the state's site doesn't appear to use the ""total people tested"" label accurately.**
&gt; 
&gt; ""From a definition standpoint, 'total people tested' and what it actually represents is 'total number of tests conducted.' 

&gt;Those are two different measures,"" says Prins, explaining that she has been tested — but **if she were tested again, she shouldn't be counted as a separate person.**
&gt; 
&gt; She's just a person who has been tested twice.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's a distinction there between total number of people tested versus total number of tests carried out.""

bboyjkang,,,"&gt;**messing with data**

lol it was pretty obvious:

&gt; In March, when the Miami Herald sought information from the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner’s Office about COVID-19 deaths, attorneys for the state health department moved to block the records from becoming public.
&gt;     
&gt; When the Tampa Bay Times found medical examiner data didn’t match the state’s records, the **state ordered medical examiners not to release the numbers.**
 
`miamiherald/com/news/coronavirus/article242050696.html`

&gt; **The Miami Herald reported last week that Florida refused for weeks to release data** on COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, even as many other states did so.
&gt; 
&gt; ""[The state health department]'s public data are incomplete, sometimes changed without explanation, and have had information removed following questions from reporters,"" the Herald reports.

`npr/org/2020/06/14/876584284/fired-florida-data-scientist-launches-a-coronavirus-dashboard-of-her-own`

&gt; **Officials in Florida did not respond to repeated requests** for comment about why the state isn’t following federal guidelines.

`washingtonpost/com/investigations/cdc-wants-states-to-count-probable-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths-but-most-arent-doing-it/2020/06/07/4aac9a58-9d0a-11ea-b60c-3be060a4f8e1_story.html`

&gt; **Unlike some other states, Florida does not count anyone who has not been tested but that a doctor determined was a “probable” case of COVID-19.**
&gt; 
&gt; This has the potential to produce an undercount in total cases, hospitalizations and COVID-related deaths.

`miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243195161.html`

&gt; Initially Florida began calculating the “positivity rate” by dividing positive tests on a given day by total test results on the same day.
&gt; 
&gt; **But the state then shifted and began dividing first-time positive individuals by total tests.**
&gt; 
&gt; The first-time group is smaller, since people who test positive are often later retested multiple times to see if they have shed the disease.
&gt; 
&gt; That change would lead to a lowering of the positivity rate.

`miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243195161.html`

&gt; **Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, finds Jones' dashboard to be more comprehensive than the state's.**
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's some data on there that either wasn't on the Florida COVID-19 DOH dashboard or was available and maybe wasn't presented in the same way that it's being presented now ...
&gt; 
&gt; You're just getting a bigger picture of what's going on,"" Prins says.
&gt; 
&gt; **She also notes that the state's site doesn't appear to use the ""total people tested"" label accurately.**
&gt; 
&gt; ""From a definition standpoint, 'total people tested' and what it actually represents is 'total number of tests conducted.' 

&gt;Those are two different measures,"" says Prins, explaining that she has been tested — but **if she were tested again, she shouldn't be counted as a separate person.**
&gt; 
&gt; She's just a person who has been tested twice.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's a distinction there between total number of people tested versus total number of tests carried out.""

bboyjkang,,,"&gt;**messing with data**

lol it was pretty obvious:

&gt; In March, when the Miami Herald sought information from the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner’s Office about COVID-19 deaths, attorneys for the state health department moved to block the records from becoming public.
&gt;     
&gt; When the Tampa Bay Times found medical examiner data didn’t match the state’s records, the **state ordered medical examiners not to release the numbers.**
 
`miamiherald/com/news/coronavirus/article242050696.html`

&gt; **The Miami Herald reported last week that Florida refused for weeks to release data** on COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, even as many other states did so.
&gt; 
&gt; ""[The state health department]'s public data are incomplete, sometimes changed without explanation, and have had information removed following questions from reporters,"" the Herald reports.

`npr/org/2020/06/14/876584284/fired-florida-data-scientist-launches-a-coronavirus-dashboard-of-her-own`

&gt; **Officials in Florida did not respond to repeated requests** for comment about why the state isn’t following federal guidelines.

`washingtonpost/com/investigations/cdc-wants-states-to-count-probable-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths-but-most-arent-doing-it/2020/06/07/4aac9a58-9d0a-11ea-b60c-3be060a4f8e1_story.html`

&gt; **Unlike some other states, Florida does not count anyone who has not been tested but that a doctor determined was a “probable” case of COVID-19.**
&gt; 
&gt; This has the potential to produce an undercount in total cases, hospitalizations and COVID-related deaths.

`miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243195161.html`

&gt; Initially Florida began calculating the “positivity rate” by dividing positive tests on a given day by total test results on the same day.
&gt; 
&gt; **But the state then shifted and began dividing first-time positive individuals by total tests.**
&gt; 
&gt; The first-time group is smaller, since people who test positive are often later retested multiple times to see if they have shed the disease.
&gt; 
&gt; That change would lead to a lowering of the positivity rate.

`miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243195161.html`

&gt; **Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, finds Jones' dashboard to be more comprehensive than the state's.**
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's some data on there that either wasn't on the Florida COVID-19 DOH dashboard or was available and maybe wasn't presented in the same way that it's being presented now ...
&gt; 
&gt; You're just getting a bigger picture of what's going on,"" Prins says.
&gt; 
&gt; **She also notes that the state's site doesn't appear to use the ""total people tested"" label accurately.**
&gt; 
&gt; ""From a definition standpoint, 'total people tested' and what it actually represents is 'total number of tests conducted.' 

&gt;Those are two different measures,"" says Prins, explaining that she has been tested — but **if she were tested again, she shouldn't be counted as a separate person.**
&gt; 
&gt; She's just a person who has been tested twice.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's a distinction there between total number of people tested versus total number of tests carried out.""

bboyjkang,,,"&gt;**messing with data**

lol it was pretty obvious:

&gt; In March, when the Miami Herald sought information from the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner’s Office about COVID-19 deaths, attorneys for the state health department moved to block the records from becoming public.
&gt;     
&gt; When the Tampa Bay Times found medical examiner data didn’t match the state’s records, the **state ordered medical examiners not to release the numbers.**
 
`miamiherald/com/news/coronavirus/article242050696.html`

&gt; **The Miami Herald reported last week that Florida refused for weeks to release data** on COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, even as many other states did so.
&gt; 
&gt; ""[The state health department]'s public data are incomplete, sometimes changed without explanation, and have had information removed following questions from reporters,"" the Herald reports.

`npr/org/2020/06/14/876584284/fired-florida-data-scientist-launches-a-coronavirus-dashboard-of-her-own`

&gt; **Officials in Florida did not respond to repeated requests** for comment about why the state isn’t following federal guidelines.

`washingtonpost/com/investigations/cdc-wants-states-to-count-probable-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths-but-most-arent-doing-it/2020/06/07/4aac9a58-9d0a-11ea-b60c-3be060a4f8e1_story.html`

&gt; **Unlike some other states, Florida does not count anyone who has not been tested but that a doctor determined was a “probable” case of COVID-19.**
&gt; 
&gt; This has the potential to produce an undercount in total cases, hospitalizations and COVID-related deaths.

`miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243195161.html`

&gt; Initially Florida began calculating the “positivity rate” by dividing positive tests on a given day by total test results on the same day.
&gt; 
&gt; **But the state then shifted and began dividing first-time positive individuals by total tests.**
&gt; 
&gt; The first-time group is smaller, since people who test positive are often later retested multiple times to see if they have shed the disease.
&gt; 
&gt; That change would lead to a lowering of the positivity rate.

`miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article243195161.html`

&gt; **Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, finds Jones' dashboard to be more comprehensive than the state's.**
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's some data on there that either wasn't on the Florida COVID-19 DOH dashboard or was available and maybe wasn't presented in the same way that it's being presented now ...
&gt; 
&gt; You're just getting a bigger picture of what's going on,"" Prins says.
&gt; 
&gt; **She also notes that the state's site doesn't appear to use the ""total people tested"" label accurately.**
&gt; 
&gt; ""From a definition standpoint, 'total people tested' and what it actually represents is 'total number of tests conducted.' 

&gt;Those are two different measures,"" says Prins, explaining that she has been tested — but **if she were tested again, she shouldn't be counted as a separate person.**
&gt; 
&gt; She's just a person who has been tested twice.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's a distinction there between total number of people tested versus total number of tests carried out.""

Do Florida hospitals not get over crowded when non-citizens die there?

&gt;and overruled the State Medical Examiner's cause of death ruling in recording some cases.

Because they're a politician towing the line for desantas?

&gt; A major Chinese supplier of consumer electronics components, Lens Technology, has been accused of using forced Uighur labor workers from the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, China, according to a report from the Tech Transparency Project shared with The Verge.

&gt; The report says Lens Technology - a gadget glass supplier to companies like Amazon, Apple, and Tesla - has used thousands of such workers as part of the Chinese government&amp;#039;s ongoing detention and forced labor campaign against the Uighur minority.

&gt; Apple has denied any role in or connection to China&amp;#039;s forced labor practices, saying it regularly investigates its suppliers as part of its auditing process and has seen no evidence that Lens Technology has used such workers on Apple production lines.

She was charged and is under investigation. Stalking and *spreading* the revenge porn to his work place. ""Allegedly.""

mathicus11,,,"[Here is an AP article that goes into a bit more detail about why she was fired and what the data discrepancy was.](https://apnews.com/article/eaf591c566f99175234d0d3d031777bf)

The fact that this entire ""conspiracy"" has now been spackled over and her claims now being considered fact, and often exaggerated, is problematic.

From the article:
&gt;Jones has not alleged any tampering with data on deaths, hospital symptom surveillance, hospitalizations for COVID-19, numbers of new confirmed cases, or overall testing rates — core elements of any assessment of the outbreak and of federal criteria for reopening. And Jones acknowledges Florida has been relatively transparent — for which she herself claims some credit — and relatively successful in controlling the pandemic.

&gt;She has, however, suggested Health Department managers wanted her to manipulate information to paint a rosier picture and that she pushed back. In an interview late Friday on CNN she finally cited some detail, after several days of vague statements.

&gt;She said the state made changes in April to support its initial reopening May 4, for example by altering the way it reports the positivity rate of testing in a way she disagreed with. Instead of showing the rate of all positive tests, it began showing the rate of new positive tests — filtering out people who previously tested positive.

...

In other words, the State wanted to display the data differently and she didn't agree with the way they wanted to display it. 

One could argue that they were trying to display the numbers in a more positive light, but couldn't you also make the argument that maybe she wanted to display the data in a more pessimistic light?

To me, it sounds like she was fired for multiple reasons and her refusal to follow reasonable orders was the straw that broke the camel's back. Now she's mad that she was fired and is hurling accusations of a non-existent or barely-existent ""conspiracy"".

*Edit: I've pasted this comment in a few threads now, because everyone has already accepted the popular narrative about the situation and turned her into some kind of folk hero.
