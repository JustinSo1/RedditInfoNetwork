dr_mcstuffins,"“I am essential,” he said of remaining open, saying, “I’m a preacher — I talk to God!”

It sounds like he hit the nail on the head with this explanation for why churches aren’t closing - it’s a massive threat to the ego of church leaders. They want to feel essential and insist that they are; that they are special and different not just from other businesses but other religions as well. They make a global problem all about them. I think his feelings were genuinely hurt that he wasn’t considered essential and took it super personally. It’s a very human thing to do and, if we are honest, a lot of people probably feel the same way. The difference is that his feelings got him and likely members of his congregation sick as well.

leagcy,"The original joke was about floods. Here is the joke coopted in Singlish.

A plagues descends on a small nation, and the number of cases soon turns into a flood. As the numbers rise, the local preacher and his congregate kneels in prayer on the church porch, surrounded by social distancing. By and by, one of the government official comes up the street wearing a mask.

""Oi, what time liao still dun wan stop ah?""

""No,"" says the preacher. ""I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.""

Still the cases rise. Now some of the congregate are showing symptoms, coughing their lungs in supplication, when a doctor zips up with some hand sanitizer.

""Come lah, Preacher. Don't be stubborn leh. DORSON gonna break red any minute.""

Once again, the preacher is unmoved. ""I shall remain. The Lord will see me through.""

After a while DORSCON goes red, and the precautions rushes over the nation until only the church remains a place of congregation. The preacher is up there, preaching to his flock, when a helicopter descends out of the clouds, and a LHL calls down to him through a megaphone.

""We highly recommend you stop the services, Mr Preacher. This is you and your members' last chance.""

Once again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.

And, predictably, he gets infected and dies.

A pious man, the preacher goes to heaven. After a while he gets an interview with God, and he asks the Almighty, ""Lord, I had unwavering faith in you. Why didn't you deliver us from the virus?""

God shakes his head. ""NB, Limpeh send gahmen official, limpeh send doctor, limpeh even send LHL, you all don't want listen still come blame limpeh

I have a voicemail my wife left me with my son when he was 2. He's 13 now. I listen to it every few months. If I ever lost it, I would be devastated. 

I'm so sorry to hear that you got frozen out. Your weren't able to attend your father's funeral, but if grief or regret is too much, you can always hold your own memorial service with your immediate family to remember and grieve as you need. When a good friend of mine passed away 7 years ago, I couldn't attend the funeral because I live too far away and had too many responsibilities to just up and travel the 1500 miles to be there. I got to see pictures of his funeral and memorial, but I was heartbroken I wasn't going to get to say goodbye.

I was pretty despondent, considering we had lost contact with each other for the last few years of his life. After an extremely emotional shift, a coworker of mine suggested writing a letter to him. I wrote a short letter, detailing the things I regretted and enjoyed about the times we had together. I went out to my back yard, and picked a place where flowers grow wild. I read the letter out loud, cried about it, and then buried the letter under the flowers. I said goodbye as best I could. It helped me get out things I didn't realize I was holding on to, and the grieving process was finally able to continue. I stand out by the flowers every now and then, not necessarily to think of him, but just to think about anything. It's my thoughtful place now. I've been thinking about building or getting a bench to place there so I can just sit and be thoughtful of life on the nice days. Maybe I'll write in my journal while I'm sitting there.

QuadNip31,"Since you have so many questions let me clear some of them up:

1.  Masks do work (both indoors and outdoors).  But just because you wear a mask 100% of the time doesn't mean you won't catch it, it lessens the likelihood but is not fool proof.  Just like how you can never smoke a day in your life and still get lung cancer.  Masks also severely lessen the amount you spread it if you are asymptomatic, presymptomatic or symptomatic.  Wearing a mask is much more effective at reducing the amount you spread it than it is at protecting you from catching it, but you do recieve a benefit either way. Not wearing a mask in public is just incredibly selfish.  Wear a mask.

2.  You transmit more of the virus if you are symptomatic than if not.  You also project it more.  For example if you have a cough you expel the virus farther than if you are just breathing normally. But either way you are still expelling it and can still get other people sick.

3.  Being outdoors greatly reduces the risk of catching or spreading it, but again it is not zero.  When you cough or breath indoors the air (and therefore the virus) gets cycled around the room you are in and through the HVAC system.  So people within the room, even if socially distanced, are more likely to breath it in.  When you are outdoors the virus gets expelled into the environment greatly reducing the chances that someone will breath it in.

4.  The rest of your statement is incoherent rambling which doesn't make much sense.  Has the ""narrative"" changed over the year?  Yes, that's how learning works.  At first we weren't sure how it was spread, so you recieved information about wiping down surfaces and what not.  Now we know it primarily spreads through the air, which is why you don't see the advice about wiping down your Amazon packages anymore. A lot of the ""narrative"" you see changing is due to us learning more about it mixed with idiots who didn't understand what the guidance was in the first place.",1608314059,,gg9v19p,False,t3_kfk81n,t1_gg9lc84,1608353715,15,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

QuadNip31,"Since you have so many questions let me clear some of them up:

1.  Masks do work (both indoors and outdoors).  But just because you wear a mask 100% of the time doesn't mean you won't catch it, it lessens the likelihood but is not fool proof.  Just like how you can never smoke a day in your life and still get lung cancer.  Masks also severely lessen the amount you spread it if you are asymptomatic, presymptomatic or symptomatic.  Wearing a mask is much more effective at reducing the amount you spread it than it is at protecting you from catching it, but you do recieve a benefit either way. Not wearing a mask in public is just incredibly selfish.  Wear a mask.

2.  You transmit more of the virus if you are symptomatic than if not.  You also project it more.  For example if you have a cough you expel the virus farther than if you are just breathing normally. But either way you are still expelling it and can still get other people sick.

3.  Being outdoors greatly reduces the risk of catching or spreading it, but again it is not zero.  When you cough or breath indoors the air (and therefore the virus) gets cycled around the room you are in and through the HVAC system.  So people within the room, even if socially distanced, are more likely to breath it in.  When you are outdoors the virus gets expelled into the environment greatly reducing the chances that someone will breath it in.

4.  The rest of your statement is incoherent rambling which doesn't make much sense.  Has the ""narrative"" changed over the year?  Yes, that's how learning works.  At first we weren't sure how it was spread, so you recieved information about wiping down surfaces and what not.  Now we know it primarily spreads through the air, which is why you don't see the advice about wiping down your Amazon packages anymore. A lot of the ""narrative"" you see changing is due to us learning more about it mixed with idiots who didn't understand what the guidance was in the first place.",1608314059,,gg9v19p,False,t3_kfk81n,t1_gg9lc84,1608353715,15,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

stabbingbrainiac,"If my coworker had never suggested the letter thing, I might've held on to some toxic feelings for far too long. We fell out of touch with each other for a few years because life took us in different directions. He reached out to me in Dec the year before he passed and we talked for like 2 hours, and then texted a bit between then and Feb when he passed. I felt so bad that I had lost touch with him during those years and only was able to scrape the surface in the 2 hours we talked. I'm so grateful now that I had been able to have that last conversation, but I hated myself for not trying harder. 

My daughter picks those flowers every now and then and gives them to my wife. I can't help but think of my friend when I see them in the vase on the table.

Funny thing, my coworker who suggested the letter thing... his mom passed a couple months ago. He was only allowed extremely limited visitation with her while she was in the hospital. She didn't pass from covid, she had cancer I think. Anyways, I mentioned to him (just a few minutes ago) about how I've been talking to random strangers about how he helped me and thanked him again for the suggestion. After our conversation, he walked away, and then came back maybe 20 seconds later, and told me thanks, because he realized he has a letter he needs to write now.",1608392527,,ggd8kwr,False,t3_kfk81n,t1_ggcowj6,1608419812,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

omegafivethreefive,"It's a question of balancing risks.

For example, some vaccines may cause severe side effects in an extremely small portion of the population (we're talking &lt;0.0001%) but they prevent tens of millions of deaths worldwide. This is an acceptable risk and a societal choice.

Should people from terrorist hotzones be checked thoroughly? Without a question. That's extremely far from a blanket ban however.

The risk of Islamic extremism in North America isn't nearly high enough to justify a blanket ban on everyone entering a country. It has been said many times by the FBI that right-wing nationalism IS the main terrorist threat and efforts should be focused there first and foremost.

Not going out sucks for everyone, we all miss seeing our friends and families but it's such a tiny sacrifice when it means it can save (literally) millions of live across the world.

It's risk analysis and we have to follow the experts (CDC, Fauci, international orgs) not ""what we want to do"".

Hell, I'd love to go out for a beer with my buddies or see my family, it's been half a year since I've seen them.

to just be with a small group, which felt comforting in its own way too; easy to be yourself.

Dr_Dankology,"That is contrary to Trump's government policies though, he consistently cut agency funding all over the place because he wishes for small and local government instead of federal agencies. 

The CDC itself had already its funding cut before this virus broke out too. For example the CDC had its funding reduced from working in 49 other countries to just 10 in 2018 after they did not get their funding renewed by Congress nor the Administration. The countries they scaled their work back in October 2019 include China by the way,

Then under John Bolton (working in Trump's administration) disbanded the National Security's Pandemic Response in 2018.

In October 2019, together with the non-renewed CDC funding the Administration also cut funding towards a Pandemic Early detection programme ending it called PREDICT. 

So it is hard to reason that he wants to save spending to reinvest in agencies when saving spending of the agencies themselves is already a hallmark policy of his administration.  If that is the argument, then removing funding from the CDC, from PREDICT and from the National Security's Pandemic Response in the first place shouldn't have happened... and these are just those related to this virus.

Ray192,"You don't seem to understand what they were actually saying. In their full report (WHO doesn't report to countries via twitter), they clearly acknowledged the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, but couldn't find clear evidence of SUSTAINED transmission.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSKBN1ZD16J

“From the information that we have it is possible that there is **limited human-to-human transmission**, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no **sustained human-to-human transmission**,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.

There is a big difference between limited and sustained H2H transmission, as defined in WHO timeline:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/

&gt; In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. **Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.**

&gt; Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks”. The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk of a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

So no, showing that there did exist H2H transmission before Jan. 14, doesn't mean the WHO was lying, because it's fully possible that in the available data of the time, the few cases of H2H didn't present clear proof of sustained H2H.

Dr_Dankology,"That is contrary to Trump's government policies though, he consistently cut agency funding all over the place because he wishes for small and local government instead of federal agencies. 

The CDC itself had already its funding cut before this virus broke out too. For example the CDC had its funding reduced from working in 49 other countries to just 10 in 2018 after they did not get their funding renewed by Congress nor the Administration. The countries they scaled their work back in October 2019 include China by the way,

Then under John Bolton (working in Trump's administration) disbanded the National Security's Pandemic Response in 2018.

In October 2019, together with the non-renewed CDC funding the Administration also cut funding towards a Pandemic Early detection programme ending it called PREDICT. 

So it is hard to reason that he wants to save spending to reinvest in agencies when saving spending of the agencies themselves is already a hallmark policy of his administration.  If that is the argument, then removing funding from the CDC, from PREDICT and from the National Security's Pandemic Response in the first place shouldn't have happened... and these are just those related to this virus.

Ray192,"You don't seem to understand what they were actually saying. In their full report (WHO doesn't report to countries via twitter), they clearly acknowledged the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, but couldn't find clear evidence of SUSTAINED transmission.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSKBN1ZD16J

“From the information that we have it is possible that there is **limited human-to-human transmission**, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no **sustained human-to-human transmission**,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.

There is a big difference between limited and sustained H2H transmission, as defined in WHO timeline:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/

&gt; In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. **Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.**

&gt; Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks”. The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk of a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

So no, showing that there did exist H2H transmission before Jan. 14, doesn't mean the WHO was lying, because it's fully possible that in the available data of the time, the few cases of H2H didn't present clear proof of sustained H2H.

Dr_Dankology,"That is contrary to Trump's government policies though, he consistently cut agency funding all over the place because he wishes for small and local government instead of federal agencies. 

The CDC itself had already its funding cut before this virus broke out too. For example the CDC had its funding reduced from working in 49 other countries to just 10 in 2018 after they did not get their funding renewed by Congress nor the Administration. The countries they scaled their work back in October 2019 include China by the way,

Then under John Bolton (working in Trump's administration) disbanded the National Security's Pandemic Response in 2018.

In October 2019, together with the non-renewed CDC funding the Administration also cut funding towards a Pandemic Early detection programme ending it called PREDICT. 

So it is hard to reason that he wants to save spending to reinvest in agencies when saving spending of the agencies themselves is already a hallmark policy of his administration.  If that is the argument, then removing funding from the CDC, from PREDICT and from the National Security's Pandemic Response in the first place shouldn't have happened... and these are just those related to this virus.

Ray192,"You don't seem to understand what they were actually saying. In their full report (WHO doesn't report to countries via twitter), they clearly acknowledged the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, but couldn't find clear evidence of SUSTAINED transmission.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSKBN1ZD16J

“From the information that we have it is possible that there is **limited human-to-human transmission**, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no **sustained human-to-human transmission**,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.

There is a big difference between limited and sustained H2H transmission, as defined in WHO timeline:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/

&gt; In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. **Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.**

&gt; Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks”. The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk of a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

So no, showing that there did exist H2H transmission before Jan. 14, doesn't mean the WHO was lying, because it's fully possible that in the available data of the time, the few cases of H2H didn't present clear proof of sustained H2H.

Ray192,"See, you people love to criticize the WHO but haven't got an  ounce of scientific education to realize what they're actually talking about. 

The WHO didn't say human-to-human wasn't possible, they said there wasn't enough evidence to go from LIMITED H2H to SUSTAINED H2H:

&gt;In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and **an unprotected caregiver.** However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.

&gt; Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks”. The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk of a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/

A doctor getting infected is specifically called out in Phase 3 as a possibility, that still isn't enough proof that a disease can casually infect someone without close contact.

You can argue where or not there was enough evidence at that time for SUSTAINED H2H, but you would actually have to know the difference between SUSTAINED and LIMITED, and you clearly don't.",1586913764,,fnfr6zb,False,t3_g1fi31,t1_fnfq6xw,1586941275,14,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

These claims got spread around in the media and on Reddit and basically made it sound like the the WHO was deliberately ignoring Taiwan's warnings. As a result of this and other things (like when some HK journalist started asking about the political status of Taiwan within the WHO during an interview with an WHO official and said official abruptly cut her off) Taiwan and the WHO got into a big slap fight. 

In the past few days, Taiwan released the actual email they sent to the WHO. This email reveals that instead of them warning about H2H transmission, it was merely them asking about an outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases they saw reported in the local Chinese media, NOT them providing any sort of warning. The full email stated: 

&gt; News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, CHINA. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were believed not SARS; however the samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment.

LeeLooTheWoofus,"It goes both ways. We hear it from both sides.

People don't like their posts/comment getting removed, and instead of reviewing the rules to determine why the post was removed - they jump to the easy out of assuming the mods are out to get them or conspiring against them.

That is so far from the truth that when I see claims like yours I have to speak up and point out the fallacy.  Trust me, I hear it from Democrats and Republicans, Liberals and Conservatives, Pro-China and anti-China, and every other polar view you can imagine when their comment/post gets removed for a violation they don't agree with

Arti241,"Hey dumbass, I've been in a country wide lockdown since the 17th.

The world is not just china and the us. I'm also looking at japan. They don't have it under control yet. The isn't a single country with more than 100 cases that has it fully under control, except china says it does, with extremely low numbers and some evidence that doesn't seem to support those numbers. 

By the way, cute source, very catchy name. Unfortunately it's quite biased. Looks like they won't fail a fact check, but they have a clear agenda. 

https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fair-media-bias
https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fairness-accuracy-in-reporting-fair/

And trump is very critical of china. 

But let's dissect your link. They say china has improved pandemic response. Granted. They talk about who inspections. The problem is that the who is pretty clearly not handling this pandemic well and seems to be in China's corner. Normally I wouldn't think twice about trusting the who, but they've proven themselves untrustworthy (the response to the woman who asked them about Taiwan, thr fact that they didn't recommend restricting travel and in fact said that countries shouldn't restrict travel). So that's the first two points of the article. 

The New England Journal of Medicine piece is 100% by China's CDC. It's state funded and we're discussing if the state is lying. Not helpful in debunking. 

The Lancet article is who funded and uses the numbers from china and predicts a 3% death rate which might lower as technology advances. Most countries do not have a 3% death rate. 

The science mag piece doesn't say anything except china is sending people back to work. It doesn't address if they're lying or not. 

The Bloomberg article is literally just a Chinese official saying nuh-uh! We didn't lie! https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-02/china-accuses-u-s-of-shifting-virus-blame-after-intel-report 

And let's look at this quote:

&gt;  If China is merely pretending to have the coronavirus under control, the pathogen will rapidly surge as people resume interacting with their communities. 

That's what's apparently happening. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/

But they are saying they're all foreign cases. They're setting up for ""China was fine until we got it from all of you people!""",1586437280,,fmw1hag,False,t3_fxdwoa,t1_fmvy1o7,1586437282,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Fluttertree321,"Infectivity is how fast it spreads, and lethality is how fast it kills, pretty self-explanatory.

Noticeability depends on lethality and severity, and cure priority/world effort depends on how widespread it is and how lethal/severe it is.

Severity is where it gets fun. It’s how severely a symptom affects you - for example Coma pretty much shuts down your whole body (high severity). but its not very lethal. But the in-game mechanics are: it increases your passive DNA gain and DNA from red bubbles. This is vital to snowball. Also, it increases the cure requirement and slows down the cure. That’s right. People avoid severity because they think it speeds up the cure. It increases human attention and dedication, but once cure priority is at max, severity only helps against the cure. The reason why people get cured is because they tried to go too infective (and you’re not even as infective as if you just got more severity since you get DNA snowball effect) and not severe enough. If you try to go full infectivity + total organ failure in MB or even brutal, you’ll die out.

Lethality can also slow down the cure progress because of population control, if you take out countries with good labs/research money then you severely hamper their ability.

People are afraid of being “too severe” or “too lethal” and end up shooting themselves in the foot. The passive infectivity strat works only in lower difficulties, and even then you get a crappy score and it’s super boring.

What you want to do is shoot for high infectivity AND severity, and don’t be afraid to go lethal early on. You can even go super lethal mid-game and you won’t kill out countries because your infectivity will be a full bar or higher. I see people in normal or brutal try to wait to the end to “reveal” + total organ failure and still end up with 50% cure progress. I’ve played mega-brutal games where I reveal from the get-go and still end up with 17% cure progress when I win because of high severity + tons of leftover DNA for a few reshuffles.",1586455824,,fmwzljx,False,t3_fxdwoa,t1_fmwwci7,1586458113,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Remember, the government's way of determining payment is *by diagnosis.* so its quite reasonable to pay a bit extra when the patient has covid because their care is more complicated.  But don't think the hospital makes bank as a result.  First, like all gov't payments, the amount given is far less than the actual cost of extra resources.  But the punch in the gut is, hospitals with active covid cases typically stop all nonurgent services, and the result is closed operating services, and anything that can get put off is, which means the hospital's  income plummets and they start frantically cancelling staff.  The reality is covid is financially devastating hospitals.

Remember, the government's way of determining payment is *by diagnosis.* so its quite reasonable to pay a bit extra when the patient has covid because their care is more complicated.  But don't think the hospital makes bank as a result.  First, like all gov't payments, the amount given is far less than the actual cost of extra resources.  But the punch in the gut is, hospitals with active covid cases typically stop all nonurgent services, and the result is closed operating services, and anything that can get put off is, which means the hospital's  income plummets and they start frantically cancelling staff.  The reality is covid is financially devastating hospitals.

I hear you. I reached that point a couple weeks ago... I've been so angry and scared and heartsick all these months, and finally it hit me that I've spent all that time grieving for complete strangers, which honestly doesn't help anyone or change anything. I also realized that many (though not all) of those who get sick now, with all the knowledge that's available to us, have only themselves to blame. I don't have any more emotional energy left to feel pain for those who don't care about anyone. I'm just sorry for the nurses, teachers, grocery store workers, bus drivers, etc. whose lives apparently don't matter to people in this country. Everyone who goes out partying, spouting conspiracy theories, and refusing to wear masks (and generally acting like idiots) can die a miserable death, for all I care.

Remember, the government's way of determining payment is *by diagnosis.* so its quite reasonable to pay a bit extra when the patient has covid because their care is more complicated.  But don't think the hospital makes bank as a result.  First, like all gov't payments, the amount given is far less than the actual cost of extra resources.  But the punch in the gut is, hospitals with active covid cases typically stop all nonurgent services, and the result is closed operating services, and anything that can get put off is, which means the hospital's  income plummets and they start frantically cancelling staff.  The reality is covid is financially devastating hospitals.

But don't think the hospital makes bank as a result.  First, like all gov't payments, the amount given is far less than the actual cost of extra resources.  But the punch in the gut is, hospitals with active covid cases typically stop all nonurgent services, and the result is closed operating services, and anything that can get put off is, which means the hospital's  income plummets and they start frantically cancelling staff.

Nighthawk700,"I'm sorry, but no. Health care fraud is one of the highest priorities by the FBI and they aren't the only ones looking into it.

The average hospital brings in $334 million annually. About 1.1 million covid patients were serious or greater in symptom classification (but didn't die). Let's say HALF of those were falsely put on a ventilator or billed as such (incredibly unlikely). That's 220 bonus patients per hospital out of the 6,140 hospitals in the US. If medicaid paid each one of those the extra money you're coming in at 0.5% increase in a hospital's average take home.

*  During one of the most highly focused on and scrutinized pandemics in history.

*  Using one of the most paper trail heavy systems there are (medicaid).

*  In one of the most paper trail heavy industries (medical care)

*  All while people have been consistently accusing them of fraud since lockdowns began, no doubt increasing the odds regulators will be pushed to find fraud.

You're out of your mind. And before you talk about how hospitals are hurting for money due to a lack of elective surgeries, they aren't going to fuck themselves over a 0.5% re-gain in revenue. Committing business ending fraud under the above conditions for an amount of money that will make no difference to your financial situation? You honestly think that's happening on a rampant scale?

TL;DR People who genuinely believe this haven't actually put any thought into it

Edit: I put more thought into it. You could probably do no actual investigation besides looking at existing CDC statistics on patient numbers and ventilator use, cross reference with international statistics and run a statistical analysis accounting for comorbities that would increase the likelihood a vent and easily detect whether ventilator fraud is likely happening in US hospitals.

PeterPablo55,"Dude, if you even mention that your life is good, you get downvoted. Like if you say ""I make enough money through my job to buy a house, car, insurance and have money left over to do fun things,"" you will get downvoted. Either they hate it or they absolutely think that nobody is able to take care of themselves. I honestly think that most people in here believe that the government should be taking care of all your needs. You are not allowed to say that you have no problem finding a job and make enough money there in order to live a good life. It really is crazy. Like, my life is good. I've always worked and make a very comfortable living. I have never had the government give me extra money to survive.

I'm not saying it is a bad thing for the government to help people out but people in here seem to think that taking care of yourself is a horrible thing to do. You are not supposed to be able to pay your own health insurance. Go ahead and post that you have no problem paying for your health insurance and being able to cover that cost is not a big deal for you. You will get downvoted. You have to say that health insurance is impossible for you to get and you will be bankrupt when the next hospital bill comes in. You are not allowed to say your life is good. I really don't understand this. It's like these people live such miserable lives and hate people that are actually doing good. Why is it so bad to completely take care of yourself and not have to worry about having the government covering all your bills? I swear people in here are fighting so hard to have everyone completely dependent on the government. I can't stand having to rely on someone else to live. I want to go out and completely take care of myself. I want to be in charge of what is going on in my life. What is causing all these people wanting someone else to take care of them. They really do think it is bad to completely support yourself and not complain about doing it. 

Things are actually really good for me right now. The most annoying part of my life is just having to wear a mask when I go out. That isn't something that is too bad to worry about lol. But you are absolutely not allowed to say things are good for you. You are also not allowed to talk about things that you think may make things better tomorrow. You are only allowed to criticize things that have already happened. No looking forward, you have to live in the past. You can't look forward to things that may get better. I have no idea what caused this mindset but these people are depressing. I couldn't imagine living like them. They also offer up no solutions to anything.

Considering there is a lot we don’t know (can we contract it more than once? Does that increase or decrease our survival chance?) Im just using what’s available.

We also know that some deaths are being attributed to other things. While some people are also asymptomatic. Others still catch it and just don’t get tested because they “don’t want to inflate the numbers.” Too many variables.

We’ll never actually know the true rate for year now. It’s an unknown.

So removing the unknown factor, Im left with what I know. The current number of total cases and deaths. And the assumption that the largest variance is going to be that people catch it without symptoms (mainly kids).

Kinda funny that the conspiracy theorists never point out the flu death number is based on way more assumptions than the covid number.

teasz5,"It took me a bit longer to become furious...

I went into self quarantine March 14.  I spent the next three months begging people to mask and distance.  By June I was furious, having been told every variance of the BS:  ""masks don't work"", ""I am medically exempt"", ""it's ***only*** a 1% death rate"", ""you do you and I'll do me"", and my all time ***favorite*** --- ""if you are so afraid stay home"".  Many friends and family members despite knowing my medical issues, my 5 year old grandson's medical issues, and my mother's medical issues, made it clear they didn't give a damn about anyone.  At that point I quit asking nicely and they took offense.  I had to remove so many people from my life just to stay semi-sane.  Even now 6 months in with all the scientific data that has been generated so far and our numbers are still climbing they still won't believe and I'm even more furious.  My now very small circle are doing everything we can to fight this virus and yet we are forced to continue to shelter in place while the ones who refuse to do anything get to continue going around and infecting everyone.  No actual mandates, just strong suggestions.  Low paid essential workers literally risking their lives to provide food, etc. only to be yelled at, beaten and even killed for asking customers to mask.  Yeah, I'm long past my tipping point and my initial fears of no end in sight until maybe the end of 2021 might actually be realistic.

PeterPablo55,"Dude, if you even mention that your life is good, you get downvoted. Like if you say ""I make enough money through my job to buy a house, car, insurance and have money left over to do fun things,"" you will get downvoted. Either they hate it or they absolutely think that nobody is able to take care of themselves. I honestly think that most people in here believe that the government should be taking care of all your needs. You are not allowed to say that you have no problem finding a job and make enough money there in order to live a good life. It really is crazy. Like, my life is good. I've always worked and make a very comfortable living. I have never had the government give me extra money to survive.

I'm not saying it is a bad thing for the government to help people out but people in here seem to think that taking care of yourself is a horrible thing to do. You are not supposed to be able to pay your own health insurance. Go ahead and post that you have no problem paying for your health insurance and being able to cover that cost is not a big deal for you. You will get downvoted. You have to say that health insurance is impossible for you to get and you will be bankrupt when the next hospital bill comes in. You are not allowed to say your life is good. I really don't understand this. It's like these people live such miserable lives and hate people that are actually doing good. Why is it so bad to completely take care of yourself and not have to worry about having the government covering all your bills? I swear people in here are fighting so hard to have everyone completely dependent on the government. I can't stand having to rely on someone else to live. I want to go out and completely take care of myself. I want to be in charge of what is going on in my life. What is causing all these people wanting someone else to take care of them. They really do think it is bad to completely support yourself and not complain about doing it. 

Things are actually really good for me right now. The most annoying part of my life is just having to wear a mask when I go out. That isn't something that is too bad to worry about lol. But you are absolutely not allowed to say things are good for you. You are also not allowed to talk about things that you think may make things better tomorrow. You are only allowed to criticize things that have already happened. No looking forward, you have to live in the past. You can't look forward to things that may get better.

Spe333,"Whenever I would look up number of total cases and compare it to the number of total deaths, it was between 4-5%. It’s dropped now though.

ATM I see 6.6 Million cases, 196k deaths.
So it’s down to 3%

Considering there is a lot we don’t know (can we contract it more than once? Does that increase or decrease our survival chance?) Im just using what’s available.

We also know that some deaths are being attributed to other things. While some people are also asymptomatic. Others still catch it and just don’t get tested because they “don’t want to inflate the numbers.” Too many variables.

We’ll never actually know the true rate for year now. It’s an unknown.

So removing the unknown factor, Im left with what I know. The current number of total cases and deaths. And the assumption that the largest variance is going to be that people catch it without symptoms (mainly kids).

I didn’t move the goal posts. If you don’t see the difference in taking decisive action in Mar/Apr vs August, I don’t know what to tell you.

PeterPablo55,"Dude, if you even mention that your life is good, you get downvoted. Like if you say ""I make enough money through my job to buy a house, car, insurance and have money left over to do fun things,"" you will get downvoted. Either they hate it or they absolutely think that nobody is able to take care of themselves. I honestly think that most people in here believe that the government should be taking care of all your needs. You are not allowed to say that you have no problem finding a job and make enough money there in order to live a good life. It really is crazy. Like, my life is good. I've always worked and make a very comfortable living. I have never had the government give me extra money to survive.

I'm not saying it is a bad thing for the government to help people out but people in here seem to think that taking care of yourself is a horrible thing to do. You are not supposed to be able to pay your own health insurance. Go ahead and post that you have no problem paying for your health insurance and being able to cover that cost is not a big deal for you. You will get downvoted. You have to say that health insurance is impossible for you to get and you will be bankrupt when the next hospital bill comes in. You are not allowed to say your life is good. I really don't understand this. It's like these people live such miserable lives and hate people that are actually doing good. Why is it so bad to completely take care of yourself and not have to worry about having the government covering all your bills? I swear people in here are fighting so hard to have everyone completely dependent on the government. I can't stand having to rely on someone else to live. I want to go out and completely take care of myself. I want to be in charge of what is going on in my life. What is causing all these people wanting someone else to take care of them. They really do think it is bad to completely support yourself and not complain about doing it. 

Things are actually really good for me right now. The most annoying part of my life is just having to wear a mask when I go out. That isn't something that is too bad to worry about lol. But you are absolutely not allowed to say things are good for you. You are also not allowed to talk about things that you think may make things better tomorrow. You are only allowed to criticize things that have already happened. No looking forward, you have to live in the past. You can't look forward to things that may get better. I have no idea what caused this mindset but these people are depressing. I couldn't imagine living like them. They also offer up no solutions to anything.

Spe333,"Whenever I would look up number of total cases and compare it to the number of total deaths, it was between 4-5%. It’s dropped now though.

ATM I see 6.6 Million cases, 196k deaths.
So it’s down to 3%

Considering there is a lot we don’t know (can we contract it more than once? Does that increase or decrease our survival chance?) Im just using what’s available.

We also know that some deaths are being attributed to other things. While some people are also asymptomatic. Others still catch it and just don’t get tested because they “don’t want to inflate the numbers.” Too many variables.

We’ll never actually know the true rate for year now. It’s an unknown.

So removing the unknown factor, Im left with what I know. The current number of total cases and deaths. And the assumption that the largest variance is going to be that people catch it without symptoms (mainly kids).

I’m glad that it’s down to 3%. Hopefully I’m wrong and it drops down to 1% over time.

I didn’t move the goal posts. If you don’t see the difference in taking decisive action in Mar/Apr vs August, I don’t know what to tell you.

This increase in cases could cause and increase in deaths per infection if it overwhelms medical facilities.

SvenDia,"Doctors rarely see flu deaths. IIRC, it’s most often detected in post-mortem tests. In the US, a few states each year take part in that testing program and those numbers feed into the yearly flu estimate. Only a few hundred to a few thousand people a year have flu listed on their death certificates.  The rest is just extrapolating the test data to 50 states and assuming a certain percentage of deaths from pneumonia and other diseases were caused in part by the flu. Kinda funny that the conspiracy theorists never point out the flu death number is based on way more assumptions than the covid number.

I went into self quarantine March 14.  I spent the next three months begging people to mask and distance.  By June I was furious, having been told every variance of the BS:  ""masks don't work"", ""I am medically exempt"", ""it's ***only*** a 1% death rate"", ""you do you and I'll do me"", and my all time ***favorite*** --- ""if you are so afraid stay home"".  Many friends and family members despite knowing my medical issues, my 5 year old grandson's medical issues, and my mother's medical issues, made it clear they didn't give a damn about anyone.  At that point I quit asking nicely and they took offense.  I had to remove so many people from my life just to stay semi-sane.  Even now 6 months in with all the scientific data that has been generated so far and our numbers are still climbing they still won't believe and I'm even more furious.  My now very small circle are doing everything we can to fight this virus and yet we are forced to continue to shelter in place while the ones who refuse to do anything get to continue going around and infecting everyone.  No actual mandates, just strong suggestions.  Low paid essential workers literally risking their lives to provide food, etc. only to be yelled at, beaten and even killed for asking customers to mask.

Like if you say ""I make enough money through my job to buy a house, car, insurance and have money left over to do fun things,"" you will get downvoted. Either they hate it or they absolutely think that nobody is able to take care of themselves. I honestly think that most people in here believe that the government should be taking care of all your needs. You are not allowed to say that you have no problem finding a job and make enough money there in order to live a good life. It really is crazy. Like, my life is good. I've always worked and make a very comfortable living. I have never had the government give me extra money to survive.

I'm not saying it is a bad thing for the government to help people out but people in here seem to think that taking care of yourself is a horrible thing to do. You are not supposed to be able to pay your own health insurance. Go ahead and post that you have no problem paying for your health insurance and being able to cover that cost is not a big deal for you. You will get downvoted. You have to say that health insurance is impossible for you to get and you will be bankrupt when the next hospital bill comes in. You are not allowed to say your life is good. I really don't understand this. It's like these people live such miserable lives and hate people that are actually doing good. Why is it so bad to completely take care of yourself and not have to worry about having the government covering all your bills? I swear people in here are fighting so hard to have everyone completely dependent on the government. I can't stand having to rely on someone else to live. I want to go out and completely take care of myself. I want to be in charge of what is going on in my life. What is causing all these people wanting someone else to take care of them. They really do think it is bad to completely support yourself and not complain about doing it. 

Things are actually really good for me right now. The most annoying part of my life is just having to wear a mask when I go out. That isn't something that is too bad to worry about lol. But you are absolutely not allowed to say things are good for you. You are also not allowed to talk about things that you think may make things better tomorrow. You are only allowed to criticize things that have already happened. No looking forward, you have to live in the past. You can't look forward to things that may get better.

ATM I see 6.6 Million cases, 196k deaths.

Considering there is a lot we don’t know (can we contract it more than once? Does that increase or decrease our survival chance?) Im just using what’s available.

We also know that some deaths are being attributed to other things. While some people are also asymptomatic. Others still catch it and just don’t get tested because they “don’t want to inflate the numbers.” Too many variables.

We’ll never actually know the true rate for year now. It’s an unknown.

So removing the unknown factor, Im left with what I know. The current number of total cases and deaths. And the assumption that the largest variance is going to be that people catch it without symptoms (mainly kids).

Musical-Lungs,"Frontline clinical guy here.  For a person to have a death labeled as a covid death, there needs to be medical documentation showing covid infection is defendable, and that the circumstances of death are consistent for death from covid.  That means that a drunk driver, for example, who dies in a car crash is not going to have covid on his death certificate even if he was known to be positive.

The 6% issue shows that many people have no understanding of how comorbidities work.  All the CDC said was that of all covid deaths, 6% had no other factor contributing to the death.  Here's how that works.

A man goes hiking on a forest trail, and encounters a bear.  Pisses the bear off and gets mauled.  Desperately injured, he is found, taken to a hospital, and admitted to the ICU.  There, it is discovered he has diabetes and then because of that and his wounds, he becomes septic and after a week, he dies.  Death certificate says bear mauling, diabetes, and sepsis.

Some people want to say that because the majority of people have other comorbidities, that covid does not count as the cause of death.  Nope.  Covid is the bear, and the bear killed this guy.  He was not in imminent danger of dying from his diabetes, and the bear actually caused the sepsis.  Similar to covid.  People have health issues, like obesity, which is not actively killing them.  They become infected with covid and develop heart damage caused by the covid virus that weakens them enough that together with the covid and the obesity they succumb.  Their death would not have happened without the covid infection, and it is completely legitimate to say that covid killed them, even when their death certificate says covid, obesity, heart disease.  Which puts them outside the 6%.  People who choke on that statistic would never say the bear didn't kill the guy in my example.

One other thought on that, is people generally interpret the 6% as minor.  Nope again.  In the ways of causes of death, that is a hugely significant number, because it means that, in a statistically significant number of cases, *covid didn't need any help and was the sole executioner.*  That 6% is not a minor number, but one that should give us pause.  Covid can kill you alone.

This weird statistical controversy shows that many people don't have a clue about health statistics, that they form strong yet incorrect opinions about things they don't understand, and that they think they have expertise on any subject simply because they can manage google searches.

awfulsome,"Not necessarily more deadly, it will simply spread more easily.  Humidity has a large effect on the spread, and that will drop with temperatures.  Combine that with so many forced indoors as the weather worsens, and it creates a perfect environment for the spread of viruses.  This is why respiratory infections tend to be seasonal.  

This increase in cases could cause and increase in deaths per infection if it overwhelms medical facilities.  The disease itself should only become deadlier if it mutates to a more virulent form that is able to spread readily.

SvenDia,"Doctors rarely see flu deaths. IIRC, it’s most often detected in post-mortem tests. In the US, a few states each year take part in that testing program and those numbers feed into the yearly flu estimate. Only a few hundred to a few thousand people a year have flu listed on their death certificates.  The rest is just extrapolating the test data to 50 states and assuming a certain percentage of deaths from pneumonia and other diseases were caused in part by the flu. Kinda funny that the conspiracy theorists never point out the flu death number is based on way more assumptions than the covid number.

Spe333,"Whenever I would look up number of total cases and compare it to the number of total deaths, it was between 4-5%. It’s dropped now though.

ATM I see 6.6 Million cases, 196k deaths.

Considering there is a lot we don’t know (can we contract it more than once? Does that increase or decrease our survival chance?) Im just using what’s available.

We also know that some deaths are being attributed to other things. While some people are also asymptomatic. Others still catch it and just don’t get tested because they “don’t want to inflate the numbers.” Too many variables.

We’ll never actually know the true rate for year now. It’s an unknown.

So removing the unknown factor, Im left with what I know. The current number of total cases and deaths. And the assumption that the largest variance is going to be that people catch it without symptoms (mainly kids).

Expat_analyst,"Cause of death can be complex.

Consider something like pancreatic cancer.  On its own, if it stays in situ, it won't kill you.  However, it spreads to other organs and stresses the body.  If a patient has, e.g., a pre-existing cardiovascular condition then that stress might lead to a heart attack or stroke which is the immediate cause of death.  However, the pancreatic cancer is the proximate cause of death because without the cancer, the heart attack wouldn't have happened (at least not at that time).

It's the same with COVID (or flu, pneumonia, etc).  The virus stresses the body and is the proximate cause of death.  The immediate cause of death is most likely an organ with a pre-existing condition, as this is perhaps the patient's weak point, but without COVID it wouldn't have happened (at least not at that time).",1600295606,,g5it3qt,False,t3_itj641,t1_g5fxp5j,1600362107,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Trump is doing everything in his power to steal the election.  Every ten years the census happens and we redraw all the congressional districts.

Trump wants right wing thugs to “guard” all the polling stations to discourage minorities from voting.

&gt;My (admittedly, outsider) view is that the US has become a country where everyone reflexively does the opposite of whatever the other side does, regardless of what's right or wrong.

This is pretty spot on as someone who lives here, and grew up somewhere else. The Republicans could easily rebrand themselves the not Democrats. They are against bills they literally wrote just because the Democrats brought them to the table as a compromise (Obamacare). The Democrats do it too but definitely not as much.

The whole thing is so blatantly broken, I'm not sure what the solution is but it has officially cost thousands of lives this year. We are the richest country on earth and in my relatively progressive city (LA) we still can't even get people to wear masks and stay home. This country is fucked.

Consider something like pancreatic cancer.  On its own, if it stays in situ, it won't kill you.  However, it spreads to other organs and stresses the body.  If a patient has, e.g., a pre-existing cardiovascular condition then that stress might lead to a heart attack or stroke which is the immediate cause of death.  However, the pancreatic cancer is the proximate cause of death because without the cancer, the heart attack wouldn't have happened (at least not at that time).

It's the same with COVID (or flu, pneumonia, etc).  The virus stresses the body and is the proximate cause of death.  The immediate cause of death is most likely an organ with a pre-existing condition, as this is perhaps the patient's weak point, but without COVID it wouldn't have happened (at least not at that time).",1600295606,,g5it3qt,False,t3_itj641,t1_g5fxp5j,1600362107,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

His first step for healthcare is to fully fund and implement Obamacare which didn’t suck (for the poor anyway) and isn’t against a M4A bill that congress can agree on.  He’s also in support of universal background checks for firearms, but again, congress makes the laws, the president just signs them.  

Trump is doing everything in his power to steal the election.  Every ten years the census happens and we redraw all the congressional districts. If the GOP stays in control they’ll push gerrymandering to its extreme, making it impossible for us to pull the government back left for another decade.  Trump wants right wing thugs to “guard” all the polling stations to discourage minorities from voting.  Him and the GOP want to raid every dollar of public funds for the top .1% of the rich, and fuck everyone else.   If we protest we get tear gassed and shot with rubber bullets.

However, the pancreatic cancer is the proximate cause of death because without the cancer, the heart attack wouldn't have happened (at least not at that time).

It's the same with COVID (or flu, pneumonia, etc).  The virus stresses the body and is the proximate cause of death.

brcguy,"Biden/Harris have committed to decriminalize weed - leaving it to the states, which will be the first real step towards real legalization.  His first step for healthcare is to fully fund and implement Obamacare which didn’t suck (for the poor anyway) and isn’t against a M4A bill that congress can agree on.  He’s also in support of universal background checks for firearms, but again, congress makes the laws, the president just signs them.  

Trump is doing everything in his power to steal the election.  Every ten years the census happens and we redraw all the congressional districts. If the GOP stays in control they’ll push gerrymandering to its extreme, making it impossible for us to pull the government back left for another decade.  Trump wants right wing thugs to “guard” all the polling stations to discourage minorities from voting.  Him and the GOP want to raid every dollar of public funds for the top .1% of the rich, and fuck everyone else.   If we protest we get tear gassed and shot with rubber bullets.  If we go on strike we get evicted.  Maybe as someone not in the US you can’t feel how different public life feels now compared to even five years ago.  The social contract is broken.  People look at each other with suspicion, at least in my liberal city deep in far right Texas. Things feel tense, like extremists on both sides are just waiting for the signal to start shooting.  
Remember how tense the breakup of the Soviet Union felt? The Balkan civil war? Violence in Chechnya and Georgia?  It can happen here, except there are more privately owned firearms here than people.

""Vaccines cause many harmful side effects, illnesses, and even death - not to mention possible long-term effects we don't even know about.""
Vaccines are actually very safe, despite implications to the contrary in many anti-vaccine publications. Most vaccine adverse events are minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. These can often be controlled by taking paracetamol after vaccination. More serious adverse events occur rarely (on the order of one per thousands to one per millions of doses), and some are so rare that risk cannot be accurately assessed. As for vaccines causing death, again so few deaths can plausibly be attributed to vaccines that it is hard to assess the risk statistically. Each death reported to ministries of health is generally thoroughly examined to assess whether it is really related to administration of vaccine, and if so, what exactly is the cause. When, after careful investigation, an event is felt to be a genuine vaccine-related event, it is most frequently found to be a programmatic error, not related to vaccine manufacture.

**TL;DR** Short-term side effects are really the only thing to worry about with any vaccine. Long-term effects are extremely rare and when they do happen, they're not catastrophic.

As you said yourself, the *known* effects of COVID-19 are almost certainly worse than any vaccine side effects might be.",1605716958,,gcqcoej,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcq7agx,1605764835,41,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

asoap,"Not only are they verified by an independent board.  The data is collected and study supervised by an indpendent board.  For this type of study Pfizer has no clue what's going on.  They only found out a couple of days before the press release how their vaccine was doing.  And in that case they only get a peek at some of the data.  

So what happened was that it's setup that when X amount of people get the virus, they then unblind the data on those people.   The independent company goes in and looks at the data to find out who got the vaccine and who got the placebo.  Then they give that data to Pfizer.  

This is what is called a double blind study. 

More info

&gt; As is standard for clinical trials, the data was “blinded,” meaning that no one except the independent board — not the volunteers, doctors, or the company’s top executives — knows how many of the 94 people sickened by the virus got the vaccine or the placebo. Given the estimate that the vaccine is over 90 percent effective, however, we can safely assume very few people who were vaccinated got Covid-19.

If you find any that don't meet your standards, make sure to record them and ask your doctor. The vaccine bottle will include the manufacturer, designation, and batch numbers.

It may be that you have limited choices at first, so you'll have to evaluate the relative risks if it comes up.

My own reason for not worrying about it is that even these cases we're taking about had _extremely rare_ side effects. That AS03 caused something like 0.04% of people to have side effects that wouldn't have without it. That's enough to withdraw it and use a safer version, but way less dangerous than coronavirus.

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases. In other words, they won´t be enought to stop the spread of the disease in a substantial way and, taking this into account, it wouldn´t be too reasonable to let them cut corners at this point to deploy the vaccine before their results are published and peer-reviewed, specially with the data of age groups and so.

Personally, I think it would be very short-minded to rush to buy the 1st vaccine that is approved just because it's the first, if there are strong roots to think that a better one would be released in a matter of a few months.  
I can understand the pressure to try to make the current situation a little bit more tolerable, but with 'not good enough' vaccines, we are not going to be able to make it.

And considering that in most of places, the elderly and most vulnerable people are meant to receive the vaccine first (as well as the health workers, etc..), it would be extremely important to be sure about the possible benefits vs adverse events of these vaccines, as the volunteers for these studies are usually healthy people.",1606249526,,gdhayed,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqmljj,1606253933,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases. In other words, they won´t be enought to stop the spread of the disease in a substantial way and, taking this into account, it wouldn´t be too reasonable to let them cut corners at this point to deploy the vaccine before their results are published and peer-reviewed, specially with the data of age groups and so.

Personally, I think it would be very short-minded to rush to buy the 1st vaccine that is approved just because it's the first, if there are strong roots to think that a better one would be released in a matter of a few months.  
I can understand the pressure to try to make the current situation a little bit more tolerable, but with 'not good enough' vaccines, we are not going to be able to make it.

And considering that in most of places, the elderly and most vulnerable people are meant to receive the vaccine first (as well as the health workers, etc..), it would be extremely important to be sure about the possible benefits vs adverse events of these vaccines, as the volunteers for these studies are usually healthy people.",1606249526,,gdhayed,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqmljj,1606253933,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases. In other words, they won´t be enought to stop the spread of the disease in a substantial way and, taking this into account, it wouldn´t be too reasonable to let them cut corners at this point to deploy the vaccine before their results are published and peer-reviewed, specially with the data of age groups and so.

Personally, I think it would be very short-minded to rush to buy the 1st vaccine that is approved just because it's the first, if there are strong roots to think that a better one would be released in a matter of a few months.  
I can understand the pressure to try to make the current situation a little bit more tolerable, but with 'not good enough' vaccines, we are not going to be able to make it.

And considering that in most of places, the elderly and most vulnerable people are meant to receive the vaccine first (as well as the health workers, etc..), it would be extremely important to be sure about the possible benefits vs adverse events of these vaccines, as the volunteers for these studies are usually healthy people.",1606249526,,gdhayed,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqmljj,1606253933,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Vaccines aren't made with new magical space ingredients. They are made with known entities, and it's usually not a surprise what side effects are apparent from those specific ingredients. Barring immediate immune response effects, Vaccines aren't exactly an unknown science.

Are you worried about the effects of the flu vaccine 20 years from now? Why, and what part do you think will cause those effects? What ingredients? You can look up every single thing that goes into them.

If you have a specific worry, I would ask about for the list of ingredients.

These kind of materials, that require such specific temperatures, are shipped with temperature recording devices/dataloggers. So if the temperature goes beyond the right limits, it would be recorded and the people who receive the shipment would be able to check it.

The units where this vaccines would be stored (ideally ultra low temperature freezers) should include temperature recording devices (internal or external) so any excursion could be recorded, too.If so, the most critical point might be those moments when the vaccines are being moved from one container to another or pulled into a freezers, as you cannot track their temperature while they are 'on the air'; so this should be done as fast as possible and following a proper protocol.

The facilities that store clinical samples (biobanks or labs) at ultra low temperature usually have redundant empty freezers (at least the ones that follow the good practices) to be able to transfer the whole content of a freezer to one of the empty ones in the event that it fails.

tinaoe,"&gt; how many of those ""vaccines and treatments"" have been tested on humans

Plenty of them have! Here's a few articles from before Covid started: [prostate cancer vaccine,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rna-vaccine) [overview of mRNA vaccines,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906799/) [a report on a Moderna Chikungunya Vaccine human trials](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-phase-1-results-first-systemic/). There was just never the urgency you have now. There's plenty of funding going into cancer or HPV research, but nowhere near the money that's being pumped into Covid. That allows you to skip steps that you'd usually take. Usually, you wouldn't immediately enrol 40.000 people into your vaccine trial, because those things are expensive. If you have a say HPV treatment, you'll start smaller to get results that can justify the expense of bigger trials. And that takes time.

What if there were people that got covid in the vaccine group but were asymptomatic? How would anyone know they got it? What if people in the vaccine group did have symptoms but either could not get a test or got a false negative result (which could be up to 30%)??

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases. In other words, they won´t be enought to stop the spread of the disease in a substantial way and, taking this into account, it wouldn´t be too reasonable to let them cut corners at this point to deploy the vaccine before their results are published and peer-reviewed, specially with the data of age groups and so.

Personally, I think it would be very short-minded to rush to buy the 1st vaccine that is approved just because it's the first, if there are strong roots to think that a better one would be released in a matter of a few months.  
I can understand the pressure to try to make the current situation a little bit more tolerable, but with 'not good enough' vaccines, we are not going to be able to make it.

And considering that in most of places, the elderly and most vulnerable people are meant to receive the vaccine first (as well as the health workers, etc..), it would be extremely important to be sure about the possible benefits vs adverse events of these vaccines, as the volunteers for these studies are usually healthy people.",1606249526,,gdhayed,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqmljj,1606253933,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"Most of vaccines so far can be stored at -20ºC (a pretty regular freezer) or above, so it's not  the same scenario at all.

The problem is not the distribution of the vaccine to the place they are meant to be stored first. In fact, Pfeizer has suggested they would take care of this (so I'm assuming they would even cover the costs if there's a problem with a lot at that stage)

The problem is the storage and distribution to the 'vaccination spots' from that point.

The dry ice containers sound a little bit like a delusional idea. They might be perfect for transport and distribution, but not for long-term storage.Dry ice sublimates into the air, so you cannot just dump these containers in any place as you could eventually get high concentrations of CO2 in that environment if it's not well ventilated. They cannot be perfectly sealed as the pressure would start to increase until the container eventually explote.Even the process of refilling with dry ice could be problematic as if it is not properly carried out or designed, the vaccines could be exposed to higher temperatures in the process.

So, the obvious device to store this vaccines for the mid-long-term would be ultra-low temperature freezers. They would require physical space, a good temperature monitoring system, trained staff and a constant power supply.So, this would be probably one of the most critical bottlenecks: to what extent would the hospitals or clinics be able to inoculate the vaccine at a pace fast enough, considering clinical staff and hospitals are currently almost collapsed in many places.On the meantime, a sufficient supply of vaccines would need to be stored somewhere, and a container filled with dry ice is not a good idea at all (it would for the shipment, but not as much for the storage itself).

If all the logistics would be already quite complex in the 'rich' countries that already have a preexistant infrastructure to build from, the 'poor countries' would be in a really weak position to be able to store this vaccine.",1606248232,,gdh87vg,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcwiips,1606252363,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

And I stick to my last comment, that one you don't seem to like.

It's based on an opinion (that might be as biased as any other, including yours) but also based on the facts I've been observing so far in my experience.

Is it normal (even reasonable, ethic...) that a company makes a press release saying 'we found out our product has an effectivity of X%', then another company says 'our product has an effectivity of X+2% and then the first company hits back saying 'so now we've seen our effectivity is X+5%'? Is it normal or reasonable? I don't think so.
Is it common? I don't think so, I haven't seen such a thing, so far. This is a commercial war, has very little to do with science as far as I'm concerned. Science speaks with hypothesis and facts, not through press statments which people has to believe just based on faith.

If the data had gone on the other direction, would have they rushed to update that number in just a matter of days? I highly doubt it. They would have waited, and they would have kept gathering more data. At some point, they would obviously need to release their conclussions, but nothing is written about having to update every single finding at real time. Nobody does it, and these same companies haven't been doing that when it was not convenient for their interests. That's a fact.

Specifically, there are huge limitations in the design of both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines which makes them not as promising as some people might be willing to believe. And the press is generally failing to explain this properly. I haven't seen any effort from these companies to clarify any of these points and stick to the truth; on the contrary, I've read interviews of some of the people involved on some of these trials that were just feeding hopes (again on the basis of pure faith until they release the data).

The fact that this has happened to you or you have seen similar things in the past doesn't make it acceptable or good per se, neither it means everyone involved in research is happy with this way of doing things.
As I said, I believe this puts the whole sector in jeopardy and contributes to feed misbeliefs and distrust in science in general.
From 1950 to recent times, bioethics has been an evolving field of research and health care, improving the care of the patients and volunteers, providing more and better information, more robust consents.... Recently, it seems that corporate interests are trying to take advantage of the situation to make it go backwards.

I may write too much (we all have our flaws), but if I do is because I believe in giving arguments to expose my ideas and because this is something I feel passionate about.
Research pays my salary but I haven't any money invested on it (as you said you have), so we might have completely different (even opposed) visions about it.

It is a fact that some people have already made a fortune in the stock market following all these announcements. It might be legal, it might be in accordance to the rules of the game, but I firmly believe this is immoral in the current situation.

As a matter of fact, I think we will never be able to fully defeat this pandemic if the economic interest of the big pharma companies are to prevail over other considerations. A global effort should be made for the best vaccines to be fairly distributed worldwide. I'm aware there have been some initiatives, but I feel they are insufficient and the media is (conciously or not) doing the dirty job for the corporate interests above the common interest.

MonkeyBot16,"It might depend a lot on the brand, model, etc...of the freezer; as well on how old it is, is in good shape? how much empty space there is into it?...

But based on my experience, if a freezer fails, it will take around 2h (more or less depending on different variables) to go above -70ºC, and from that point is quite likely that the integrity of the samples (vaccine in this case) would be lost.

And you don´t even need to picture a catastrophic scenario to consider how this samples/vaccines could be spoiled. For instance, if you keep the door of an ultra-low freezer at -80ºC for 45seconds, you will most likely have a temperature excursion above -70ºC.  
So, the problem is not only in terms of shipping the vaccines and storing them, well trained staff might be required if you don´t want hundreds of thousands of vaccines being spoiled at the same time just because someone open the door for too long while grabbing a dose of the vaccine. Even the way these vaccines are deposited should be carefully planned and carried out following some specific procedures.

It's not abnormal to keep samples at ultra-low temperature in clinical research, actually this is one of the most common means of long-term storage and it allows for the trials to be reproducible. But it is quite common, too, that this is an aspect that has been commonly overlooked and has been done without following the best practices. Biobanks have an increasingly important role in clinical research, but they struggle to survive and they have to face a lot of problems so far.  
And that only referring to their role focused on clinical research. Now, we would be facing at a challenge of a scale never seen.

It is not impossible, tho, but it would require a huge effort and an even larger investment of money and resources. So, if a government was about to decide which vaccine is the most suitable, all these additional costs and planning efforts should be taken into account, as if they are overlooked it could lead to invest a crazy amount of money in a vaccine that would be eventually spoiled inside a freezer.",1606246422,,gdh4duj,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcrldx7,1606250173,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

lovememychem,"So first: mutation is possible, especially on the long-term scale; if that happens, then we’ll make a new vaccine and adjust, should be way faster the second time. It’s unlikely to be a mutation that immediately forms a new pandemic with no warning or opportunity to form a vaccine; mutations are a natural thing and we know how to monitor.

There’s a few points re: side effects down the line. I could go into the biological details of why it’s unlikely (and I’m happy to do that if you’re interested) but there’s a few simpler points as welll. So first, that’s basically unheard of — the vast, vast, vast majority of side effects occur within 60 days of vaccination, which is why the FDA set that as their setpoint for how much safety data they need on average before they’ll even *consider* an application for an EUA. Second, even if the vaccine did cause problems 5, 10, 20, 30 years down the line (and again — that’s extraordinarily unlikely), there’s no way of knowing that now and running the trials even longer isn’t going to tell us that either. Basically, it’s a problem that is so unlikely to occur that it’s not worth worrying about, and even if it *was* a problem, we wouldn’t have any way of figuring that out anyways, so it’s really not an area where we should be focusing our efforts and resources — mental or otherwise.

Again, I can go into the biological details of why those problems are even less likely with these particular vaccines, but let me put it this way: as someone that’s a current MD/PhD student and has spent a solid amount of time reading about this, I will have zero hesitation about getting my vaccine.

(Except for the actual injection itself, but that’s only because I *hate* needles :-) )

Oh and I’m not sure what you’re referring to when you ask what if the vaccine doesn’t work (that’s what the phase III trials have actually been testing), but if the vaccine makes everyone asymptomatic... problem solved! If people don’t get symptoms and don’t get sick when they get infected with COVID, then that’s all you need.",1605844659,,gcwpsyf,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gctwqw4,1605892460,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

It does sound spurious, and I miss typed some of the info as I was going to sleep. 

To clarify; friend was very ill (staple signs of covid. Thought he had the flu), we hung out, and then me and my roommate got very ill 13 days afterwards. 

Right now, the only reason I can rather accurately say it’s covid instead of a cold is because I’ve had a lot of experience with respiratory illnesses. I’ve had coughs from bad RSV to really bad asthma to everything in between. This cough isn’t like one I get from the a cold or the flu. It hurt; a lot. It was the first time I had actually been afraid of dying since I had RSV 20 years ago. I guess your body doesn’t forget that fear.

The other big thing that made me mostly certain covid; loss of smell/taste. I’ve never had such a... lack of taste. I’ve had it where food just tastes bad because of congestion; but it’s such a total lack of taste it’s almost surreal. 

There’s very little doubt in my mind that it isn’t covid.

Godvivec1,"&gt; By that I mean there is no actual long term evidence on how this affects a human being after 5, 10, 20 years and that’s not data that you can just simply make up

So you want them to get 20 years worth of data before giving out the vaccine. That sounds like holding it in the closet for 20 years to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  but what exactly is that telling me of how the concoction of ingredients is going to react in my body.

Research. The information is out there. Though I don't have a list of ingredients for the upcoming vaccines, I can pretty much assume they'll use the same delivery systems that most other vaccines use. Shouldn't be to hard to find scientific, peer-reviewed, research on the effects of the vaccines, and delivery systems for the vaccine. You can google, right now, Flu vaccine ingredients and find a plethora of resources breaking down every single ingredients, and what it is, and what specifically it does to your body.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I gave a source and its up to you wether you want to read what manipulation is going on right now or choose to take the Vaccine 

To put it bluntly, your source is garbage. It's one mans anecdotal evidence, and it's about smudging numbers to meet an agenda, not about the vaccine. 

It's also sad that you don't actually understand how science works. The vaccine isn't going to just get released with a ""Hey, this is the government! This works, take it!"".

The vaccine's studies and findings will be, and are being currently, independently peer-reviewed. ANY manipulation, or smudged numbers, will be discovered pretty fast. You can wait for a few independent studies to come out to make up your mind, I would understand that. But, that won't be that long after the vaccine is ready, if any time at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  And actually yes this Vaccine is very different to the Flu Vaccine for a multitude of reasons, the most obvious being that it was not developed and deemed safe within a few months. 

Irrelevant. You need perspective. Do you know how much fucking money is being thrown at this? How the entire modern world is giving blank checks to companies to get vaccines? There is one hell of a difference between that, and the flu vaccine.

Plenty of them have! Here's a few articles from before Covid started: [prostate cancer vaccine,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rna-vaccine) [overview of mRNA vaccines,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906799/) [a report on a Moderna Chikungunya Vaccine human trials](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-phase-1-results-first-systemic/). There was just never the urgency you have now. There's plenty of funding going into cancer or HPV research, but nowhere near the money that's being pumped into Covid. That allows you to skip steps that you'd usually take. Usually, you wouldn't immediately enrol 40.000 people into your vaccine trial, because those things are expensive. If you have a say HPV treatment, you'll start smaller to get results that can justify the expense of bigger trials. And that takes time.

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases. In other words, they won´t be enought to stop the spread of the disease in a substantial way and, taking this into account, it wouldn´t be too reasonable to let them cut corners at this point to deploy the vaccine before their results are published and peer-reviewed, specially with the data of age groups and so.

Personally, I think it would be very short-minded to rush to buy the 1st vaccine that is approved just because it's the first, if there are strong roots to think that a better one would be released in a matter of a few months.  
I can understand the pressure to try to make the current situation a little bit more tolerable, but with 'not good enough' vaccines, we are not going to be able to make it.

And considering that in most of places, the elderly and most vulnerable people are meant to receive the vaccine first (as well as the health workers, etc..), it would be extremely important to be sure about the possible benefits vs adverse events of these vaccines, as the volunteers for these studies are usually healthy people.",1606249526,,gdhayed,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqmljj,1606253933,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx
MonkeyBot16,"That is something that should never happen, specially during transport.

These kind of materials, that require such specific temperatures, are shipped with temperature recording devices/dataloggers. So if the temperature goes beyond the right limits, it would be recorded and the people who receive the shipment would be able to check it.

The units where this vaccines would be stored (ideally ultra low temperature freezers) should include temperature recording devices (internal or external) so any excursion could be recorded, too.If so, the most critical point might be those moments when the vaccines are being moved from one container to another or pulled into a freezers, as you cannot track their temperature while they are 'on the air'; so this should be done as fast as possible and following a proper protocol.

The facilities that store clinical samples (biobanks or labs) at ultra low temperature usually have redundant empty freezers (at least the ones that follow the good practices) to be able to transfer the whole content of a freezer to one of the empty ones in the event that it fails.

Technically it is perfectly possible and well known, but it's not as easy as some people might think or some might suggest. The issue is that it will require a huge amount of resources to be able to scale up an infrastructure like this for the numbers that are required.

This might be one of the main problems that a requirement like this might present: you don't need only the proper equipment and infrastructure, but also properly trained staff to be sure the vaccines will be handled correctly.

If the costs exceed the benefits, I think it would be fair to question if it would even worth a try, when it's expected that there will be more suitable alternatives soon.

MonkeyBot16,"Most of vaccines so far can be stored at -20ºC (a pretty regular freezer) or above, so it's not  the same scenario at all.

The problem is not the distribution of the vaccine to the place they are meant to be stored first. In fact, Pfeizer has suggested they would take care of this (so I'm assuming they would even cover the costs if there's a problem with a lot at that stage)

The problem is the storage and distribution to the 'vaccination spots' from that point.

The dry ice containers sound a little bit like a delusional idea. They might be perfect for transport and distribution, but not for long-term storage.Dry ice sublimates into the air, so you cannot just dump these containers in any place as you could eventually get high concentrations of CO2 in that environment if it's not well ventilated. They cannot be perfectly sealed as the pressure would start to increase until the container eventually explote.Even the process of refilling with dry ice could be problematic as if it is not properly carried out or designed, the vaccines could be exposed to higher temperatures in the process.

So, the obvious device to store this vaccines for the mid-long-term would be ultra-low temperature freezers. They would require physical space, a good temperature monitoring system, trained staff and a constant power supply.So, this would be probably one of the most critical bottlenecks: to what extent would the hospitals or clinics be able to inoculate the vaccine at a pace fast enough, considering clinical staff and hospitals are currently almost collapsed in many places.On the meantime, a sufficient supply of vaccines would need to be stored somewhere, and a container filled with dry ice is not a good idea at all (it would for the shipment, but not as much for the storage itself).

If all the logistics would be already quite complex in the 'rich' countries that already have a preexistant infrastructure to build from, the 'poor countries' would be in a really weak position to be able to store this vaccine.",1606248232,,gdh87vg,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcwiips,1606252363,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"I just happen to work in clinical research, so I think that your comment just shows prejudice.
And I stick to my last comment, that one you don't seem to like.

It's based on an opinion (that might be as biased as any other, including yours) but also based on the facts I've been observing so far in my experience.

Is it normal (even reasonable, ethic...) that a company makes a press release saying 'we found out our product has an effectivity of X%', then another company says 'our product has an effectivity of X+2% and then the first company hits back saying 'so now we've seen our effectivity is X+5%'? Is it normal or reasonable? I don't think so.
Is it common? I don't think so, I haven't seen such a thing, so far. This is a commercial war, has very little to do with science as far as I'm concerned. Science speaks with hypothesis and facts, not through press statments which people has to believe just based on faith.

If the data had gone on the other direction, would have they rushed to update that number in just a matter of days? I highly doubt it. They would have waited, and they would have kept gathering more data. At some point, they would obviously need to release their conclussions, but nothing is written about having to update every single finding at real time. Nobody does it, and these same companies haven't been doing that when it was not convenient for their interests. That's a fact.

Specifically, there are huge limitations in the design of both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines which makes them not as promising as some people might be willing to believe. And the press is generally failing to explain this properly. I haven't seen any effort from these companies to clarify any of these points and stick to the truth; on the contrary, I've read interviews of some of the people involved on some of these trials that were just feeding hopes (again on the basis of pure faith until they release the data).

The fact that this has happened to you or you have seen similar things in the past doesn't make it acceptable or good per se, neither it means everyone involved in research is happy with this way of doing things.
As I said, I believe this puts the whole sector in jeopardy and contributes to feed misbeliefs and distrust in science in general.
From 1950 to recent times, bioethics has been an evolving field of research and health care, improving the care of the patients and volunteers, providing more and better information, more robust consents.... Recently, it seems that corporate interests are trying to take advantage of the situation to make it go backwards.

I may write too much (we all have our flaws), but if I do is because I believe in giving arguments to expose my ideas and because this is something I feel passionate about.
Research pays my salary but I haven't any money invested on it (as you said you have), so we might have completely different (even opposed) visions about it.

It is a fact that some people have already made a fortune in the stock market following all these announcements. It might be legal, it might be in accordance to the rules of the game, but I firmly believe this is immoral in the current situation.

As a matter of fact, I think we will never be able to fully defeat this pandemic if the economic interest of the big pharma companies are to prevail over other considerations. A global effort should be made for the best vaccines to be fairly distributed worldwide. I'm aware there have been some initiatives, but I feel they are insufficient and the media is (conciously or not) doing the dirty job for the corporate interests above the common interest.

MonkeyBot16,"It might depend a lot on the brand, model, etc...of the freezer; as well on how old it is, is in good shape? how much empty space there is into it?...

But based on my experience, if a freezer fails, it will take around 2h (more or less depending on different variables) to go above -70ºC, and from that point is quite likely that the integrity of the samples (vaccine in this case) would be lost.

And you don´t even need to picture a catastrophic scenario to consider how this samples/vaccines could be spoiled. For instance, if you keep the door of an ultra-low freezer at -80ºC for 45seconds, you will most likely have a temperature excursion above -70ºC.  
So, the problem is not only in terms of shipping the vaccines and storing them, well trained staff might be required if you don´t want hundreds of thousands of vaccines being spoiled at the same time just because someone open the door for too long while grabbing a dose of the vaccine. Even the way these vaccines are deposited should be carefully planned and carried out following some specific procedures.

It's not abnormal to keep samples at ultra-low temperature in clinical research, actually this is one of the most common means of long-term storage and it allows for the trials to be reproducible. But it is quite common, too, that this is an aspect that has been commonly overlooked and has been done without following the best practices. Biobanks have an increasingly important role in clinical research, but they struggle to survive and they have to face a lot of problems so far.  
And that only referring to their role focused on clinical research. Now, we would be facing at a challenge of a scale never seen.

It is not impossible, tho, but it would require a huge effort and an even larger investment of money and resources. So, if a government was about to decide which vaccine is the most suitable, all these additional costs and planning efforts should be taken into account, as if they are overlooked it could lead to invest a crazy amount of money in a vaccine that would be eventually spoiled inside a freezer.",1606246422,,gdh4duj,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcrldx7,1606250173,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

lovememychem,"So first: mutation is possible, especially on the long-term scale; if that happens, then we’ll make a new vaccine and adjust, should be way faster the second time. It’s unlikely to be a mutation that immediately forms a new pandemic with no warning or opportunity to form a vaccine; mutations are a natural thing and we know how to monitor.

There’s a few points re: side effects down the line. I could go into the biological details of why it’s unlikely (and I’m happy to do that if you’re interested) but there’s a few simpler points as welll. So first, that’s basically unheard of — the vast, vast, vast majority of side effects occur within 60 days of vaccination, which is why the FDA set that as their setpoint for how much safety data they need on average before they’ll even *consider* an application for an EUA. Second, even if the vaccine did cause problems 5, 10, 20, 30 years down the line (and again — that’s extraordinarily unlikely), there’s no way of knowing that now and running the trials even longer isn’t going to tell us that either. Basically, it’s a problem that is so unlikely to occur that it’s not worth worrying about, and even if it *was* a problem, we wouldn’t have any way of figuring that out anyways, so it’s really not an area where we should be focusing our efforts and resources — mental or otherwise.

Again, I can go into the biological details of why those problems are even less likely with these particular vaccines, but let me put it this way: as someone that’s a current MD/PhD student and has spent a solid amount of time reading about this, I will have zero hesitation about getting my vaccine.

(Except for the actual injection itself, but that’s only because I *hate* needles :-) )

Oh and I’m not sure what you’re referring to when you ask what if the vaccine doesn’t work (that’s what the phase III trials have actually been testing), but if the vaccine makes everyone asymptomatic... problem solved!

MonkeyBot16,"It has to be thawed before being injected, obviously. It wouldn´t be only unreasonable to introduce something at those temperatures in the human body, it would also cause great harm to the tissues and could be dangerous.

The key of this is that above -70ºC, degradation will start, but it won´t be something that will just happen in an instant. This is obviously something that the producer has already taken into account, otherwise the vaccine would be absolutely useless.

The issue is mostly how to ensure the cold chain at all stages before the vaccine is thawed to be injected.  
If a lot or a shipment is eventually exposed to -60ºC for a very short period of time, the integrity of those vaccines could be still not totally bad and it might still be effective... But this is really hard to measure and the effects (in terms of giving an ineffective lot of the vaccine to a large number of people) could be relevant.  
And this is not something that would affect only a few vials, as they would be sent and stored in large numbers.

The other challenge that the cold chain pose is that if you have a relevant temperature excursion (let´s say above -50ºC), this could lead to the formation of crystals when the temperature is back to -80ºC.  
Freeze&amp;thaw cycles are usually terrible in terms of keeping the integrity of biological samples or similar.

MonkeyBot16,"That's not fully true.

I can tell that the data of 'every trial' and 'every new drug' has not been always released on this way. Not at all. And of course, these releases haven't had this impact so far.

Even if it was true, it might be common, but it´s not normal at all and it should raise a lot of concerns. I think that clinical research is going towards a very dangerous direction. Fortunately, not all the companies and institutions have taken the same approach, but the visibility in the media atm the is focused on these ones.  
We should learn from historical precedents, as the reputational damage caused to clinical research and health care in the long-term could be catastrophic and could translate in loss of credibility, reputational damage and a decrease of partipants for clinical trials.  
From my point of view, the greed and selfishness of a few is jeopardizing one of the main pillars of human development.

These rushed press releases, this public confrontation... is fueling up the stupid ideas of those who dimiss scientific knowledge and question the 'vaccination' itself as a concept.  
What will happen if the hype created these days is then not supported by results? More people will fall into nihilistic nonsensical ideas, refulsal to get vaccinated will be empowered...

Skepticism and prudence have been some of the qualities that have guided research for years. Faith-believing and big words have not much to do with it; it's pure marketing... at the expense of the scientific credibility.

Precedents re. other drugs might have worked on a different way. At the moment, there's a hugle pressure from most of the society wordwide to try to find something that will ease the current situation, even a little bit. This is a great opportunity for business for those who have few or non ethical concerns, but a sensitive person would try to stay prudent not to feed false expectations.  
And unfortunately, media attention hasn't been recently so focused on these issues so far. So, the companies that are rushing to make this announcements are perfectly aware of the consequences of this. If things don't go as well as expected, they would have made a fortune anyways, but the damage for the whole society would be beyond repair for a really long-term.

It would be naive to think that the economic side of research and the development of new drugs is irrelevant; but there are different ways of doing things.

Finding studies to prove vaccines are not good for you wont happen because they need to be heavily funded and cooperation needs to occur.  Imagine you own a product and an independent group under funded wants YOU to pay for our provide products to test to prove safe.  Guess what you are going to do?  make sure your product is in top shape, that you polish those that seem to like you and push out the ones looking to prove your product stinks.    

Anytime you are injecting something into your body, chemicals and other 'things', you have a risk your body wont be able to push that away.

Hashimoto's disease is a much more common thyroid disease today.  It's becoming known in some studies that vaccine materials can get into the thyroid and will be treated for life like a threat to the body and as such the bodies immune system constantly attacks the thyroid causing this disease.

hyprsloth,"I think it's safe to say that anti vaxers will be in line for this if proven effective as the alternative is more dire than what vaccines have been proven countless times to cause as it pertains to side effects and other items still being studied and squashed.   I had a friend die from the flu vaccine.  A healthy person.  That flu vaccine absolutely had ZERO ability to stop the flu strains going around that year, yet they were forced to take it by their employer.   The children sued the employer and won and it wasnt hard.

I wouldnt call myself an anti vaxer but I certainly wouldnt subject myself or my family to vaccines that are of dubious intent or effectiveness.  In this case, covid concerns outweigh potential side effects however I will 'wait awhile' like many others to see what it does to others.

95% effective, says a large pharma that stands to make billions (or at least regain their losses in research and dev on this.  How exactly is that tested?  I tried to search and in my limited time came up empty but will continue.  Do they test 95% against the fact that out of 100 people only 5 got covid?  Well that's actually NOT a good number if the participants are social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding going out etc like everyone else is (or should be).  If 5 people out of 100 at your business caught covid even though they did everything they were supposed to, you and your co workers would be demanding for safer work conditions right?

Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: ‘if you’re so smart why ain’t you rich?’ There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register. 

&gt;Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times.

Not only that, but it's largely not hippyish either. People with leftist views often view it as ""the most progressive state""...no, that's somewhere else (Hawaii, Oregon, or Washington maybe?)...living here, I personally consider it the most neoliberal state.

The hit job the right-wing has done on California blows my mind, and as far as taxation is concerned my advice would be to check the actual numbers before saying this is a high taxation state, because progressive taxation and tax brackets don't work the way you think they do.

Progressive taxation (IMO correctly) targets high wage earners more than regular working people.

Honestly, if everyone quarantines properly, I can see this being quite good in a pandemic. With a small group, following the rules means more because each person you affect is known to you individually, as opposed to being a nameless, faceless statistic. So you properly quarantine for a month, all stay safe and healthy, and then the adults still have people to see and BBQ with, the kids still have friends to play with.

Reneeisme,"$100,000 is practically the poverty line in the San Francisco bay area.  Salaries are higher, because living expenses are higher. There's more involved than how much someone earns.  It's just not that simple.  But I absolutely agree that many people are over-extended and could live more within their means.  For the sake of this argument, it doesn't really matter what they ""could"" be doing though.  It matters what they have done.  Because that's what's going to determine their situation and their behavior now.  

And it's worth remembering that our economy depends on that over-extension to such a degree that we've encouraged it.  Banks made (and continue to make, despite the recent crises) home loans that people can't afford.  Cars get sold with zero down, and loans made for them to people already in over their heads credit wise.  Credit card offers come to people who've already maxed out every card they own.  Blaming people for over-extending themselves is a bit like blaming an alcoholic for being one.  Are they responsible?  Absolutely.  Is it realistic to think they can just stop doing it on their own, or won't end up in a bad situation if it's too easy to make that choice?  Probably not.  We allow credit companies to prey on people's desires and ignorance to facilitate the over-extension most of them find themselves in.  Couple that with the huge numbers of people who actually don't make enough to live on, and you arrive at the situation we're in today, where most of the population is in serious trouble the moment the economy falters.",1595436881,,fyw000v,False,t3_hvmw0r,t1_fyvy9qj,1595506881,7,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

mtbizzle,"Folks have said this mess has unmasked a lot of problems. I'm not going to disagree. What is the cost of not having mandated, robust paid sick leave?? 

Think about the **incentives**. If you are not getting paid, or *might* not get paid while off due to concern of illness, many many people will not take off. Many will **downplay** their symptoms in their own mind to make them more comfortable doing what they have to do - go to work, take care of the family. 

That's the exact opposite behavior you want, but it's what's incentivized. And any interaction with the healthcare system could be really costly so many will avoid that unless absolutely necessary. 

I see this stuff all the time. I've see patients talk about how they essentially blew off shortness of breath and continued to go about their business at stores etc. I've heard doctors imply they're not a fan of fever checks at the hospital because being sent away due to testing high temperature means no shift and less pay. 

There are some companies with great policies, and sometimes it's probably more of a culture issue than a policy issue. But in general the incentives and disincentives leave me with little faith that 99 out of 100 times people will ""do the right thing"" and self quarantine when they are symptomatic. Which in practice means you assume everyone in a hotspot region has it and behave accordingly. GA Tech modeling estimated that in a random collection of 10 people in my county 55% chance that one or more have it.

For the sake of this argument, it doesn't really matter what they ""could"" be doing though.  It matters what they have done.  Because that's what's going to determine their situation and their behavior now.  

And it's worth remembering that our economy depends on that over-extension to such a degree that we've encouraged it.  Banks made (and continue to make, despite the recent crises) home loans that people can't afford.  Cars get sold with zero down, and loans made for them to people already in over their heads credit wise.  Credit card offers come to people who've already maxed out every card they own.  Blaming people for over-extending themselves is a bit like blaming an alcoholic for being one.  Are they responsible?  Absolutely.  Is it realistic to think they can just stop doing it on their own, or won't end up in a bad situation if it's too easy to make that choice?  Probably not.  We allow credit companies to prey on people's desires and ignorance to facilitate the over-extension most of them find themselves in.

mtbizzle,"Folks have said this mess has unmasked a lot of problems. I'm not going to disagree. What is the cost of not having mandated, robust paid sick leave?? 

Think about the **incentives**. If you are not getting paid, or *might* not get paid while off due to concern of illness, many many people will not take off. Many will **downplay** their symptoms in their own mind to make them more comfortable doing what they have to do - go to work, take care of the family. 

That's the exact opposite behavior you want, but it's what's incentivized. And any interaction with the healthcare system could be really costly so many will avoid that unless absolutely necessary. 

I see this stuff all the time. I've see patients talk about how they essentially blew off shortness of breath and continued to go about their business at stores etc. I've heard doctors imply they're not a fan of fever checks at the hospital because being sent away due to testing high temperature means no shift and less pay. 

There are some companies with great policies, and sometimes it's probably more of a culture issue than a policy issue. But in general the incentives and disincentives leave me with little faith that 99 out of 100 times people will ""do the right thing"" and self quarantine when they are symptomatic. Which in practice means you assume everyone in a hotspot region has it and behave accordingly. GA Tech modeling estimated that in a random collection of 10 people in my county 55% chance that one or more have it. That's a virtual guarantee of exposure if you are in stores unless you are very careful and mindful about viral load.",1595429887,,fyvlsfq,False,t3_hvmw0r,t1_fyuujay,1595498271,4,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Reneeisme,"$100,000 is practically the poverty line in the San Francisco bay area.  Salaries are higher, because living expenses are higher. There's more involved than how much someone earns.  It's just not that simple.  But I absolutely agree that many people are over-extended and could live more within their means.  For the sake of this argument, it doesn't really matter what they ""could"" be doing though.  It matters what they have done.  Because that's what's going to determine their situation and their behavior now.  

And it's worth remembering that our economy depends on that over-extension to such a degree that we've encouraged it.  Banks made (and continue to make, despite the recent crises) home loans that people can't afford.  Cars get sold with zero down, and loans made for them to people already in over their heads credit wise.  Credit card offers come to people who've already maxed out every card they own.  Blaming people for over-extending themselves is a bit like blaming an alcoholic for being one.  Are they responsible?  Absolutely.  Is it realistic to think they can just stop doing it on their own, or won't end up in a bad situation if it's too easy to make that choice?  Probably not.  We allow credit companies to prey on people's desires and ignorance to facilitate the over-extension most of them find themselves in.  Couple that with the huge numbers of people who actually don't make enough to live on, and you arrive at the situation we're in today, where most of the population is in serious trouble the moment the economy falters.",1595436881,,fyw000v,False,t3_hvmw0r,t1_fyvy9qj,1595506881,7,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Most districts aren’t providing PPE to staff and students. About 33% of the teacher population in this country are considered in the at-risk group (most of which because of age).

ViolaNguyen,"&gt; The hit job the right-wing has done on California blows my mind, and as far as taxation is concerned my advice would be to check the actual numbers before saying this is a high taxation state, because progressive taxation and tax brackets don't work the way you think they do.
&gt; 
&gt; Progressive taxation (IMO correctly) targets high wage earners more than regular working people.
&gt; 
&gt; For some (or maybe even most) households, you're taxed more in ""low tax"" states between state and local because they take a fixed % from your paycheck.


Property taxes suck.

They suck less in California than they do in other states (like Texas), but they're basically a regressive wealth tax that hits the middle class and the poor harder than the rich.

One reason I love California is that I can afford to own a house here.  If my house were in Texas, I'd have to worry about being able to afford the taxes.

Income tax?  Sales tax?  I don't care, because by definition I have enough money to pay income tax (and it's not that bad), and I can make my sales taxes as low as I want them to be by spending less.

""Low tax"" states need funding, too, so they just rearrange it to make room for a marketing slogan.  ""Low tax"" just means low income tax.

Quick retirement arithmetic:

Assume $20k per year for health insurance.  If you own a $300k house in Texas, then you might pay $10k in property taxes in retirement.

So, your initial retirement expenses are going to be your cost of living *plus* $30k per year.  If you're obeying the 4% rule (make your retirement funds last by spending no more than 4% per year), you're looking at $750k saved up just to cover the initial taxes and medical expenses.

MelesseSpirit,"Solidarity, young grandma sister mine. (If I didn’t mistake it, you’re 43?) I’m 45 and my first grandbaby came in January. I got to hold her only a few precious times before we went into lockdown here. But then the fact that I and my husband are immunocompromised and my mother is very high risk kicked in. 

I didn’t touch my daughter or her baby girl for *months*. And I’m annoyingly physically affectionate normally. It fucking sucked. I despise that because of this virus I missed out on a lot and I couldn’t really help my baby girl’s adjustment into her own motherhood. But as she &amp; I agreed, it was better to miss out in the short term in order to not only keep me around long term but my hubby and my mother as well. (I’m the person shopping for 2 households, keeping me healthy keeps the other two healthy too.)

Really awful for my daughter &amp; myself is that my mom adores babies. She’s a baby whisperer. And she cannot hold her great grandchild for who knows how long. But again, keeping her safe short term means she’s around for years to come, ideally. 

I’m sorry your son isn’t being safe. That sucks. Really sucks. But he’s an adult and that’s his prerogative, as yours *must* be to keep yourself safe, even from his choices. Use exactly what you said about being around to love on your family for years to come. Anything that interferes with your being able to do that should get a hard no. No debate, no wishy-washy flexibility. It’s time to break out the mom’s final “No.” with him.

 “Son, I love you, I love my DIL, I love and adore your children. My love isn’t going anywhere, but my body needs to stay safe and that requires distance and masks. I know we don’t agree on the politics here but what matters is *I believe* that my life is at risk in this situation and I love you, your siblings, my grandchildren, our family too much to take any risks. I want to have as much time on this earth as possible to continue loving my family. So unless you’re going to *respectfully* follow what I believe are the best, safest practices, I’m not going to see you. “

I disagree with this slightly, a lot of ""low tax"" states consider fixed percentage income taxes at state and local levels to be low. They aren't low when they apply to every dollar you make especially if you fall into certain income tax brackets. You can actually wind up paying less in California depending upon which tax bracket you fall into.

However, they also do exactly what you're saying and take no income tax, but have very aggressive or regressive taxation models for property. So I think we mostly agree.

whagh,"But it's the poorest people who need it the most? They're the ones who will have problem handling rent, medical bills, etc? Sounds completely flipped upside down and makes no sense at all.

Here it is almost the opposite. As the government pays your sick leave outside of the 12 days (it's actually 4x 3 day periods), it is capped at about 70,000$ per year, so that if you have a very high income above what is actually necessary, the government isn't going to keep paying you that.

What I don't understand is how this is even functional or makes any economic sense. I've had my appendix burst at 20 and was out of work for a full month. I got paid for the entire month and paid 0$ for the medical treatment. If I didn't get paid and had to pay an out of pocket cost for the medical treatment as well, I'd really struggle, and I was making 17$ an hour which was the minimum wage - and I still had very little savings (although I must admit I was spending like a drunken sailor at the time). Can't even imagine how I'd get by in the first place had I made 10$ an hour (although costs of living might be higher here). I've also been out for 6 weeks due to a knee surgery, which was also free and I got paid the whole period. If this happens in the US and you end up bankrupt and homeless or having to relocate, that could possibly force you to quit and be out of work even longer.

ViolaNguyen,"&gt; The hit job the right-wing has done on California blows my mind, and as far as taxation is concerned my advice would be to check the actual numbers before saying this is a high taxation state, because progressive taxation and tax brackets don't work the way you think they do.
&gt; 
&gt; Progressive taxation (IMO correctly) targets high wage earners more than regular working people.
&gt; 
&gt; For some (or maybe even most) households, you're taxed more in ""low tax"" states between state and local because they take a fixed % from your paycheck.


Property taxes suck.

They suck less in California than they do in other states (like Texas), but they're basically a regressive wealth tax that hits the middle class and the poor harder than the rich.

One reason I love California is that I can afford to own a house here.  If my house were in Texas, I'd have to worry about being able to afford the taxes.

Income tax?  Sales tax?  I don't care, because by definition I have enough money to pay income tax (and it's not that bad), and I can make my sales taxes as low as I want them to be by spending less.

""Low tax"" states need funding, too, so they just rearrange it to make room for a marketing slogan.  ""Low tax"" just means low income tax.

Quick retirement arithmetic:

Assume $20k per year for health insurance.  If you own a $300k house in Texas, then you might pay $10k in property taxes in retirement.

So, your initial retirement expenses are going to be your cost of living *plus* $30k per year.  If you're obeying the 4% rule (make your retirement funds last by spending no more than 4% per year), you're looking at $750k saved up just to cover the initial taxes and medical expenses.

I disagree with this slightly, a lot of ""low tax"" states consider fixed percentage income taxes at state and local levels to be low. They aren't low when they apply to every dollar you make especially if you fall into certain income tax brackets. You can actually wind up paying less in California depending upon which tax bracket you fall into.

However, they also do exactly what you're saying and take no income tax, but have very aggressive or regressive taxation models for property. So I think we mostly agree.

whagh,"But it's the poorest people who need it the most? They're the ones who will have problem handling rent, medical bills, etc? Sounds completely flipped upside down and makes no sense at all.

Here it is almost the opposite. As the government pays your sick leave outside of the 12 days (it's actually 4x 3 day periods), it is capped at about 70,000$ per year, so that if you have a very high income above what is actually necessary, the government isn't going to keep paying you that.

What I don't understand is how this is even functional or makes any economic sense. I've had my appendix burst at 20 and was out of work for a full month. I got paid for the entire month and paid 0$ for the medical treatment. If I didn't get paid and had to pay an out of pocket cost for the medical treatment as well, I'd really struggle, and I was making 17$ an hour which was the minimum wage - and I still had very little savings (although I must admit I was spending like a drunken sailor at the time). Can't even imagine how I'd get by in the first place had I made 10$ an hour (although costs of living might be higher here). I've also been out for 6 weeks due to a knee surgery, which was also free and I got paid the whole period. If this happens in the US and you end up bankrupt and homeless or having to relocate, that could possibly force you to quit and be out of work even longer.

whagh,"But it's the poorest people who need it the most? They're the ones who will have problem handling rent, medical bills, etc? Sounds completely flipped upside down and makes no sense at all.

Here it is almost the opposite. As the government pays your sick leave outside of the 12 days (it's actually 4x 3 day periods), it is capped at about 70,000$ per year, so that if you have a very high income above what is actually necessary, the government isn't going to keep paying you that.

What I don't understand is how this is even functional or makes any economic sense. I've had my appendix burst at 20 and was out of work for a full month. I got paid for the entire month and paid 0$ for the medical treatment. If I didn't get paid and had to pay an out of pocket cost for the medical treatment as well, I'd really struggle, and I was making 17$ an hour which was the minimum wage - and I still had very little savings (although I must admit I was spending like a drunken sailor at the time). Can't even imagine how I'd get by in the first place had I made 10$ an hour (although costs of living might be higher here). I've also been out for 6 weeks due to a knee surgery, which was also free and I got paid the whole period. If this happens in the US and you end up bankrupt and homeless or having to relocate, that could possibly force you to quit and be out of work even longer.

Sloppy1sts,"And I believe that those who push the narrative that the government can't do anything right are instrumental in ensuring that that remains true. They break the system so they can turn around and talk about how it doesn't work.

Social security was fine until congress started stealing from it. The USPS was completely self-sufficient until they were given the ridiculous rule that they had to have their pensions paid for like 100 years in advance. Most welfare programs provide positive economic ROI. The public school system wouldn't be so fucked up if teachers we paid well enough to attract good teachers and schools didn't draw funds from taxes of the surrounding neighborhoods, ensuring that poor kids went to poor schools. 

The power of politicians is *supposed* to be the power of the people. That's obviously been incredibly perverted, but I don't think it's an impossibility. And it's mostly due to the fact that people have been brainwashed into voting against their own interests.

The government can absolutely be made to work for us, but not if we only vote for assholes who have the opposite goals in mind and fail to hold them accountable.

Like, ""that guy knows 80% of the topics on the Roman Empire, that guy knows 90%, and that girl not only got a perfect score but got 10% extra credit because she knew additional information outside the curriculum, which can help her in future tests where she may not know that subject matter as strongly.

This test is literally just to determine, ""do they have dementia or not.""

It's pass / fail.  You can't have ""extra credit"" because there's no, like, ""super un-dementia"" condition.  You either have dementia or you don't.  What could extra credit possibly mean in this context.  It's not testing ""does he do good words.: 

Like, on the part where you draw a clock, all they're testing for is whether someone can draw a circle and place evenly-spaced digits around that circle in a coherent pattern.  It's testing certain abilities that everyone has and is easy to do *unless you're suffering from cognitive decline*.  If you draw an immaculately-rendered grandfather clock in breathtaking realistic detail - well that's great but this isn't a fucking art test and you will get the same ""passed dementia screen"" check on your medical chart that someone who drew a circle with 12 numbers inside it in the right place.

The very fact he clearly doesn't have any fucking clue what actually happened in that room is really telling.  I mean, it isn't even just that he's using this as an opportunity to brag.  He doesn't have even a basic comprehension of why he took that test or what it's doing.  He's really fucking stupid.

In people with dementia and severe cognitive decline, one thing that persists are habits.  Deeply ingrained behaviors.  For example, someone with dementia may have no trouble walking a complex route around their neighborhood that they do every day, out of habit, even if they have no idea where they are and couldn't tell you their name.  Certain habits exist below our active memory. 

Trump's lies and narcissism is so embedded that he could just do this without even knowing what was going on. 

Anything that Trump does was A) really hard, and he does B) better than anyone else.

""I turned on the lights better than anyone else.  Joe Biden couldn't turn on the lights better than I did.  And that was a hard light switch."" 

I mean it's almost verbatim what he says about anything and everything he does.

yaolilylu,"When people say that this vaccine is developed so quickly and it normally takes many years to make new vaccines, they are correct, but they forget history. The early vaccines like smallpox and rabies were so easy that a doctor could work for a few months and make a rudimentary vaccine. Jenner (smallpox) and Pauster (rabies) both succeeded basically on their first attempt, despite having only 1800's knowledge. The hard problems that are left over, like HIV, are hard because the low hanging fruits had been picked centuries ago. Covid is a brand new virus, it could have been as easy as smallpox or as hard as HIV, and so far it looks like we got very lucky and it is going to be one of the easier ones (at the very least, way easier than SARS1, where animals suffered massive allergic reactions to the first vaccine candidate. The animal experiment part of the Covid vaccine went really well.) The vaccines we talk about in recent years and takes decades of research are the toughest nuts to crack, they are not typical of the disease world.

Modern vaccines are created in such a way that safety is verified first, efficacy second. The first batch of Covid vaccine candidates already passed safety trials, I'd feel comfortable receiving the first vaccines because the potential long term complications with this type of vaccine are extremely rare (one type of influenza vaccine was weakly linked to a type of facial nerve problem, one type of H1N1 vaccine was linked to sleep disorders, there are no other long term issues that I have heard of with non-replicating vaccines). Live vaccine are much more risky, I would be very hesitant to get a rushed live vaccine, but Covid is so dangerous that no one is trying to make a live vaccine for it, especially now that it looks like the much safer options are going to work.",1595601909,,fz3fdey,False,t3_hwz1rx,t3_hwz1rx,1595659434,31,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

If you draw an immaculately-rendered grandfather clock in breathtaking realistic detail - well that's great but this isn't a fucking art test and you will get the same ""passed dementia screen"" check on your medical chart that someone who drew a circle with 12 numbers inside it in the right place.

The very fact he clearly doesn't have any fucking clue what actually happened in that room is really telling.  I mean, it isn't even just that he's using this as an opportunity to brag.  He doesn't have even a basic comprehension of why he took that test or what it's doing.  He's really fucking stupid.

In people with dementia and severe cognitive decline, one thing that persists are habits.  Deeply ingrained behaviors.  For example, someone with dementia may have no trouble walking a complex route around their neighborhood that they do every day, out of habit, even if they have no idea where they are and couldn't tell you their name.  Certain habits exist below our active memory. 

Trump's lies and narcissism is so embedded that he could just do this without even knowing what was going on. 

Anything that Trump does was A) really hard, and he does B) better than anyone else.

""I turned on the lights better than anyone else.  Joe Biden couldn't turn on the lights better than I did.  And that was a hard light switch."" 

I mean it's almost verbatim what he says about anything and everything he does. 

The fact he's doing that with a test for dementia, without even representing the way that test is actually administered, and claiming it was done by a doctor who hasn't been his doctor in over two years... it kind of sounds a lot like Trump has dementia.",1595603812,1595605835.0,fz3j572,False,t3_hwz1rx,t1_fz3df5b,1595661428,54,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

yaolilylu,"When people say that this vaccine is developed so quickly and it normally takes many years to make new vaccines, they are correct, but they forget history. The early vaccines like smallpox and rabies were so easy that a doctor could work for a few months and make a rudimentary vaccine. Jenner (smallpox) and Pauster (rabies) both succeeded basically on their first attempt, despite having only 1800's knowledge. The hard problems that are left over, like HIV, are hard because the low hanging fruits had been picked centuries ago. Covid is a brand new virus, it could have been as easy as smallpox or as hard as HIV, and so far it looks like we got very lucky and it is going to be one of the easier ones (at the very least, way easier than SARS1, where animals suffered massive allergic reactions to the first vaccine candidate. The animal experiment part of the Covid vaccine went really well.) The vaccines we talk about in recent years and takes decades of research are the toughest nuts to crack, they are not typical of the disease world.

Modern vaccines are created in such a way that safety is verified first, efficacy second. The first batch of Covid vaccine candidates already passed safety trials, I'd feel comfortable receiving the first vaccines because the potential long term complications with this type of vaccine are extremely rare (one type of influenza vaccine was weakly linked to a type of facial nerve problem, one type of H1N1 vaccine was linked to sleep disorders, there are no other long term issues that I have heard of with non-replicating vaccines). Live vaccine are much more risky, I would be very hesitant to get a rushed live vaccine, but Covid is so dangerous that no one is trying to make a live vaccine for it, especially now that it looks like the much safer options are going to work.",1595601909,,fz3fdey,False,t3_hwz1rx,t3_hwz1rx,1595659434,31,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

TheBirminghamBear,"I mean just think about the concept of extra credit.  You get extra credit on assignments testing competency on a subject.  Like, ""that guy knows 80% of the topics on the Roman Empire, that guy knows 90%, and that girl not only got a perfect score but got 10% extra credit because she knew additional information outside the curriculum, which can help her in future tests where she may not know that subject matter as strongly.

This test is literally just to determine, ""do they have dementia or not.""

It's pass / fail.  You can't have ""extra credit"" because there's no, like, ""super un-dementia"" condition.  You either have dementia or you don't.  What could extra credit possibly mean in this context.  It's not testing ""does he do good words.: 

Like, on the part where you draw a clock, all they're testing for is whether someone can draw a circle and place evenly-spaced digits around that circle in a coherent pattern.  It's testing certain abilities that everyone has and is easy to do *unless you're suffering from cognitive decline*.  If you draw an immaculately-rendered grandfather clock in breathtaking realistic detail - well that's great but this isn't a fucking art test and you will get the same ""passed dementia screen"" check on your medical chart that someone who drew a circle with 12 numbers inside it in the right place.

The very fact he clearly doesn't have any fucking clue what actually happened in that room is really telling.  I mean, it isn't even just that he's using this as an opportunity to brag.  He doesn't have even a basic comprehension of why he took that test or what it's doing.  He's really fucking stupid.

In people with dementia and severe cognitive decline, one thing that persists are habits.  Deeply ingrained behaviors.  For example, someone with dementia may have no trouble walking a complex route around their neighborhood that they do every day, out of habit, even if they have no idea where they are and couldn't tell you their name.  Certain habits exist below our active memory. 

Trump's lies and narcissism is so embedded that he could just do this without even knowing what was going on. 

Anything that Trump does was A) really hard, and he does B) better than anyone else.

""I turned on the lights better than anyone else.  Joe Biden couldn't turn on the lights better than I did.  And that was a hard light switch."" 

I mean it's almost verbatim what he says about anything and everything he does. 

The fact he's doing that with a test for dementia, without even representing the way that test is actually administered, and claiming it was done by a doctor who hasn't been his doctor in over two years... it kind of sounds a lot like Trump has dementia.",1595603812,1595605835.0,fz3j572,False,t3_hwz1rx,t1_fz3df5b,1595661428,54,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Here's how the right wing went down the rabbit hole here: it's the entire reason we even had a Brexit referendum in the first place. There was a party called UKIP, the UK Independence Party, whose entire purpose was to shit stir about Europe and demand a referendum on our EU membership. The Conservative Party, led at the time by Prime Minister David Cameron, was losing members to UKIP because of this stance, or at least the party unity was threatened by it. So in order to win the general election in 2015, Cameron promised a referendum to satisfy those elements of the party. It was purely about keeping his party together, it had nothing to do with him believing a referendum was right for the country. He campaigned - vaguely - for remaining, and assumed the vote would not result in a leave win and everything would stay normal and his party would stay united. Of course, it didn't go that way, and he ran away immediately leaving the country with this generational fucking shitshow. (Though if remain had won, it's impossible to imagine everything just settling down - whoever thought that raising the issue of our EU membership in an official referendum would sort things out rather than raise the temperature was a moron.) The leave campaigns engaged in shady advertising on social media, especially Facebook, using targeted ads to small groups of people on whom it would be most effective, and pure and simple lying. Our press had been lying about Europe for years - as a journalist in the 90s, Boris Johnson pretty much invented Euroscepticism and recalls laughing at how easy it was to make something up about the EU making laws etc. that would cause the British public to seethe with rage. And this was more of the same and worse. A whole segment of our population has been conditioned to not understand how to think critically, and to deny and twist facts to support what they already believe, and to use their distrust of those facts to further distrust the people offering them. You think we don't have a Fox News? We do, it's just not on the TV, it's been in print for decades and it's not just one newspaper. 

Anyway. The outright lies and electoral fraud and Russian interference aside. As much as I hate Theresa May and Boris Johnson and all Tories, never forget the cunt who sent us here through sheer irresponsibility and inability to lead his party, who sold his country down the river for an inevitably disastrous party political game.

Caloyalot,"He’s criticised a lot on Reddit. He won a landslide majority last election and the majority of people I have spoken to actually approve of him, saying him paying 80% of British wages through coronavirus was above and beyond. A lot of reddit is highly left leaning, such as supporting Jeremy Corbyn (the ex-labour leader) who most of the country saw as extreme left wing (such as wanting to abolish private school and redistribute wealth). I believe Trump’s presidency has been so extreme right of centre that hatred and vitriol has stirred up on the left, causing a growing support for extreme left wing and demonisation of anyone right wing. Just FYI, I myself am a Labour voter and left wing - this is just my observation. Boris has also said unsavoury things in the past, and the video you referenced he compared Muslim women wearing Burqas to “letterboxes and bank robbers”. However, politically he hasn’t really done much to undermine Muslims and also has a history of making a lot of dark jokes - so it could have just been classic British schoolboy dark humour that got out of hand.

TheBirminghamBear,"I mean just think about the concept of extra credit.  You get extra credit on assignments testing competency on a subject.  Like, ""that guy knows 80% of the topics on the Roman Empire, that guy knows 90%, and that girl not only got a perfect score but got 10% extra credit because she knew additional information outside the curriculum, which can help her in future tests where she may not know that subject matter as strongly.

This test is literally just to determine, ""do they have dementia or not.""

It's pass / fail.  You can't have ""extra credit"" because there's no, like, ""super un-dementia"" condition.  You either have dementia or you don't.  What could extra credit possibly mean in this context.  It's not testing ""does he do good words.: 

Like, on the part where you draw a clock, all they're testing for is whether someone can draw a circle and place evenly-spaced digits around that circle in a coherent pattern.  It's testing certain abilities that everyone has and is easy to do *unless you're suffering from cognitive decline*.  If you draw an immaculately-rendered grandfather clock in breathtaking realistic detail - well that's great but this isn't a fucking art test and you will get the same ""passed dementia screen"" check on your medical chart that someone who drew a circle with 12 numbers inside it in the right place.

The very fact he clearly doesn't have any fucking clue what actually happened in that room is really telling.  I mean, it isn't even just that he's using this as an opportunity to brag.  He doesn't have even a basic comprehension of why he took that test or what it's doing.  He's really fucking stupid.

In people with dementia and severe cognitive decline, one thing that persists are habits.  Deeply ingrained behaviors.  For example, someone with dementia may have no trouble walking a complex route around their neighborhood that they do every day, out of habit, even if they have no idea where they are and couldn't tell you their name.  Certain habits exist below our active memory. 

Trump's lies and narcissism is so embedded that he could just do this without even knowing what was going on. 

Anything that Trump does was A) really hard, and he does B) better than anyone else.

""I turned on the lights better than anyone else.  Joe Biden couldn't turn on the lights better than I did.  And that was a hard light switch."" 

I mean it's almost verbatim what he says about anything and everything he does. 

The fact he's doing that with a test for dementia, without even representing the way that test is actually administered, and claiming it was done by a doctor who hasn't been his doctor in over two years... it kind of sounds a lot like Trump has dementia.",1595603812,1595605835.0,fz3j572,False,t3_hwz1rx,t1_fz3df5b,1595661428,54,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

essentialatom,"Don't be fooled. We have those morons over here, and plenty of them. Boris Johnson just isn't one of them, but they were still needed to win the Brexit vote four years ago (whether Johnson, Gove and Farage *wanted* to win it is debatable, but win it they did, and they relied on these people). The UK does lack the USA's anti-intellectual culture, you guys seem to have a very strong streak of fear of and hostility towards the educated - we have it a bit but not as much. But you still don't have to look too hard to find people whose information all comes from Facebook groups and our hideous print media, and who believe in 5G/Bill Gates/George Soros/whatever else conspiracy theories.

Here's how the right wing went down the rabbit hole here: it's the entire reason we even had a Brexit referendum in the first place. There was a party called UKIP, the UK Independence Party, whose entire purpose was to shit stir about Europe and demand a referendum on our EU membership. The Conservative Party, led at the time by Prime Minister David Cameron, was losing members to UKIP because of this stance, or at least the party unity was threatened by it. So in order to win the general election in 2015, Cameron promised a referendum to satisfy those elements of the party. It was purely about keeping his party together, it had nothing to do with him believing a referendum was right for the country. He campaigned - vaguely - for remaining, and assumed the vote would not result in a leave win and everything would stay normal and his party would stay united. Of course, it didn't go that way, and he ran away immediately leaving the country with this generational fucking shitshow. (Though if remain had won, it's impossible to imagine everything just settling down - whoever thought that raising the issue of our EU membership in an official referendum would sort things out rather than raise the temperature was a moron.) The leave campaigns engaged in shady advertising on social media, especially Facebook, using targeted ads to small groups of people on whom it would be most effective, and pure and simple lying. Our press had been lying about Europe for years - as a journalist in the 90s, Boris Johnson pretty much invented Euroscepticism and recalls laughing at how easy it was to make something up about the EU making laws etc. that would cause the British public to seethe with rage. And this was more of the same and worse. A whole segment of our population has been conditioned to not understand how to think critically, and to deny and twist facts to support what they already believe, and to use their distrust of those facts to further distrust the people offering them. You think we don't have a Fox News? We do, it's just not on the TV, it's been in print for decades and it's not just one newspaper. 

Anyway. The outright lies and electoral fraud and Russian interference aside. As much as I hate Theresa May and Boris Johnson and all Tories, never forget the cunt who sent us here through sheer irresponsibility and inability to lead his party, who sold his country down the river for an inevitably disastrous party political game.

essentialatom,"Don't be fooled. We have those morons over here, and plenty of them. Boris Johnson just isn't one of them, but they were still needed to win the Brexit vote four years ago (whether Johnson, Gove and Farage *wanted* to win it is debatable, but win it they did, and they relied on these people). The UK does lack the USA's anti-intellectual culture, you guys seem to have a very strong streak of fear of and hostility towards the educated - we have it a bit but not as much. But you still don't have to look too hard to find people whose information all comes from Facebook groups and our hideous print media, and who believe in 5G/Bill Gates/George Soros/whatever else conspiracy theories.

Here's how the right wing went down the rabbit hole here: it's the entire reason we even had a Brexit referendum in the first place. There was a party called UKIP, the UK Independence Party, whose entire purpose was to shit stir about Europe and demand a referendum on our EU membership. The Conservative Party, led at the time by Prime Minister David Cameron, was losing members to UKIP because of this stance, or at least the party unity was threatened by it. So in order to win the general election in 2015, Cameron promised a referendum to satisfy those elements of the party. It was purely about keeping his party together, it had nothing to do with him believing a referendum was right for the country. He campaigned - vaguely - for remaining, and assumed the vote would not result in a leave win and everything would stay normal and his party would stay united. Of course, it didn't go that way, and he ran away immediately leaving the country with this generational fucking shitshow. (Though if remain had won, it's impossible to imagine everything just settling down - whoever thought that raising the issue of our EU membership in an official referendum would sort things out rather than raise the temperature was a moron.) The leave campaigns engaged in shady advertising on social media, especially Facebook, using targeted ads to small groups of people on whom it would be most effective, and pure and simple lying. Our press had been lying about Europe for years - as a journalist in the 90s, Boris Johnson pretty much invented Euroscepticism and recalls laughing at how easy it was to make something up about the EU making laws etc. that would cause the British public to seethe with rage. And this was more of the same and worse. A whole segment of our population has been conditioned to not understand how to think critically, and to deny and twist facts to support what they already believe, and to use their distrust of those facts to further distrust the people offering them. You think we don't have a Fox News? We do, it's just not on the TV, it's been in print for decades and it's not just one newspaper. 

Anyway. The outright lies and electoral fraud and Russian interference aside.

Caloyalot,"He’s criticised a lot on Reddit. He won a landslide majority last election and the majority of people I have spoken to actually approve of him, saying him paying 80% of British wages through coronavirus was above and beyond. A lot of reddit is highly left leaning, such as supporting Jeremy Corbyn (the ex-labour leader) who most of the country saw as extreme left wing (such as wanting to abolish private school and redistribute wealth). I believe Trump’s presidency has been so extreme right of centre that hatred and vitriol has stirred up on the left, causing a growing support for extreme left wing and demonisation of anyone right wing. Just FYI, I myself am a Labour voter and left wing - this is just my observation. Boris has also said unsavoury things in the past, and the video you referenced he compared Muslim women wearing Burqas to “letterboxes and bank robbers”. However, politically he hasn’t really done much to undermine Muslims and also has a history of making a lot of dark jokes - so it could have just been classic British schoolboy dark humour that got out of hand.

Pishleback7,"This may be an agree to disagree situation, but I would say since coming to power Boris has certainly not made the headline of Brexit about immigration. Of course, the existence of Brexit led to an increase in xenaphobia in the country, but this is due to how the far right of the leave campaign marketed it, which also was a result of a general unhappy attitude of the people. I personally think Boris has at least changed the government approach, whilst simultaneously taking votes away from the far right. Of course that doesn't stop the far right members from our population existing, but it does take the limelight away from those who promote that kind of attitude, meaning less and less will be 'radicalised'. I think Cameron would argue that the reason for the referendum in the first place was to shut the far right up for a good few decades by winning, which of course failed, but I think it's important to remember that those on the centre of the Tory party have often been concerned about losing their far right supporters, so they're very effective at destroying their parties",1595668420,,fz6jybz,False,t3_hwz1rx,t1_fz5dzrf,1595722725,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

pm_me_jk_dont,"Here's a story by the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/immunization_misconceptions/en/index4.html) and here's an excerpt:

""Vaccines cause many harmful side effects, illnesses, and even death - not to mention possible long-term effects we don't even know about.""
Vaccines are actually very safe, despite implications to the contrary in many anti-vaccine publications. Most vaccine adverse events are minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. These can often be controlled by taking paracetamol after vaccination. More serious adverse events occur rarely (on the order of one per thousands to one per millions of doses), and some are so rare that risk cannot be accurately assessed. As for vaccines causing death, again so few deaths can plausibly be attributed to vaccines that it is hard to assess the risk statistically. Each death reported to ministries of health is generally thoroughly examined to assess whether it is really related to administration of vaccine, and if so, what exactly is the cause. When, after careful investigation, an event is felt to be a genuine vaccine-related event, it is most frequently found to be a programmatic error, not related to vaccine manufacture.

**TL;DR** Short-term side effects are really the only thing to worry about with any vaccine. Long-term effects are extremely rare and when they do happen, they're not catastrophic.

As you said yourself, the *known* effects of COVID-19 are almost certainly worse than any vaccine side effects might be.",1605716958,,gcqcoej,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcq7agx,1605764835,41,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

They only found out a couple of days before the press release how their vaccine was doing.  And in that case they only get a peek at some of the data.  

So what happened was that it's setup that when X amount of people get the virus, they then unblind the data on those people.   The independent company goes in and looks at the data to find out who got the vaccine and who got the placebo.  Then they give that data to Pfizer.  

This is what is called a double blind study. 

More info

&gt; As is standard for clinical trials, the data was “blinded,” meaning that no one except the independent board — not the volunteers, doctors, or the company’s top executives — knows how many of the 94 people sickened by the virus got the vaccine or the placebo. Given the estimate that the vaccine is over 90 percent effective, however, we can safely assume very few people who were vaccinated got Covid-19.

- Achey bones and muscles
- Fever
- Tiredness
- Redness near the injection site

During the ~2 weeks after exposure to a virus, your body begins producing antibodies and new cells to fight it. They come out from your bone marrow, which causes ""achyness"".

My own reason for not worrying about it is that even these cases we're taking about had _extremely rare_ side effects.

When a bunch of the kids were sent home for showing symptoms they decided to combine that classroom with my daughter's classroom because there weren't many kids in it anymore. Ignoring the fact that hand foot and mouth disease is insanely contagious and by combining the classrooms they exposed a whole new group of kids... Well my daughter caught it and passed it along to me because she was an asymptomatic carrier, and it hit me hard. I happened to start working from home and had withdrawn her from daycare the day before I showed symptoms. 

Right before this happened my pediatrician had actually suggested we find her a new daycare because she was getting sick so often. Several of the teachers would get to keep bringing their kids even when they were sick, just so that they'd be able to come to work.",1605736743,,gcrilxv,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcr51ou,1605786023,3,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases. In other words, they won´t be enought to stop the spread of the disease in a substantial way and, taking this into account, it wouldn´t be too reasonable to let them cut corners at this point to deploy the vaccine before their results are published and peer-reviewed, specially with the data of age groups and so.

Personally, I think it would be very short-minded to rush to buy the 1st vaccine that is approved just because it's the first, if there are strong roots to think that a better one would be released in a matter of a few months.  
I can understand the pressure to try to make the current situation a little bit more tolerable, but with 'not good enough' vaccines, we are not going to be able to make it.

And considering that in most of places, the elderly and most vulnerable people are meant to receive the vaccine first (as well as the health workers, etc..), it would be extremely important to be sure about the possible benefits vs adverse events of these vaccines, as the volunteers for these studies are usually healthy people.",1606249526,,gdhayed,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqmljj,1606253933,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases. In other words, they won´t be enought to stop the spread of the disease in a substantial way and, taking this into account, it wouldn´t be too reasonable to let them cut corners at this point to deploy the vaccine before their results are published and peer-reviewed, specially with the data of age groups and so.

Personally, I think it would be very short-minded to rush to buy the 1st vaccine that is approved just because it's the first, if there are strong roots to think that a better one would be released in a matter of a few months.  
I can understand the pressure to try to make the current situation a little bit more tolerable, but with 'not good enough' vaccines, we are not going to be able to make it.

And considering that in most of places, the elderly and most vulnerable people are meant to receive the vaccine first (as well as the health workers, etc..), it would be extremely important to be sure about the possible benefits vs adverse events of these vaccines, as the volunteers for these studies are usually healthy people.",1606249526,,gdhayed,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqmljj,1606253933,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases.

These kind of materials, that require such specific temperatures, are shipped with temperature recording devices/dataloggers. So if the temperature goes beyond the right limits, it would be recorded and the people who receive the shipment would be able to check it.

The units where this vaccines would be stored (ideally ultra low temperature freezers) should include temperature recording devices (internal or external) so any excursion could be recorded, too.If so, the most critical point might be those moments when the vaccines are being moved from one container to another or pulled into a freezers, as you cannot track their temperature while they are 'on the air'; so this should be done as fast as possible and following a proper protocol.

The facilities that store clinical samples (biobanks or labs) at ultra low temperature usually have redundant empty freezers (at least the ones that follow the good practices) to be able to transfer the whole content of a freezer to one of the empty ones in the event that it fails.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases.

MonkeyBot16,"Most of vaccines so far can be stored at -20ºC (a pretty regular freezer) or above, so it's not  the same scenario at all.

The problem is not the distribution of the vaccine to the place they are meant to be stored first. In fact, Pfeizer has suggested they would take care of this (so I'm assuming they would even cover the costs if there's a problem with a lot at that stage)

The problem is the storage and distribution to the 'vaccination spots' from that point.

The dry ice containers sound a little bit like a delusional idea. They might be perfect for transport and distribution, but not for long-term storage.Dry ice sublimates into the air, so you cannot just dump these containers in any place as you could eventually get high concentrations of CO2 in that environment if it's not well ventilated. They cannot be perfectly sealed as the pressure would start to increase until the container eventually explote.Even the process of refilling with dry ice could be problematic as if it is not properly carried out or designed, the vaccines could be exposed to higher temperatures in the process.

So, the obvious device to store this vaccines for the mid-long-term would be ultra-low temperature freezers. They would require physical space, a good temperature monitoring system, trained staff and a constant power supply.So, this would be probably one of the most critical bottlenecks: to what extent would the hospitals or clinics be able to inoculate the vaccine at a pace fast enough, considering clinical staff and hospitals are currently almost collapsed in many places.On the meantime, a sufficient supply of vaccines would need to be stored somewhere, and a container filled with dry ice is not a good idea at all (it would for the shipment, but not as much for the storage itself).

If all the logistics would be already quite complex in the 'rich' countries that already have a preexistant infrastructure to build from, the 'poor countries' would be in a really weak position to be able to store this vaccine.",1606248232,,gdh87vg,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcwiips,1606252363,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"I'm not willing to accept any sort of threats.
I haven't questioned the data (would be stupid to do so before they share it), even less impliying that anyone has been cheating with them. This just can come from a lack of reading comprehension.
I've just critized the communication strategy (which is something that in a crysis of this proportions should be specially be taken into account).
I've even said that I believe that if the data had shown worse (not better) results over those days, I think they wouldn't have make a public statement about it.
So, this criticism would be more focused on Pfeizer, not Moderna.
I haven't said anything specifically about Moderna, so your accusations are nonsensical.

What I actually think is that Pfeizer's announcement triggered Moderna's one. Maybe not, but that's definetely the impression it gives from the outside, which from my Pov of doesn't look too good.
I'm not questioning the data, I'm questioning the fact of playing with expectations instead of taking a more prudent approach.
They have been speaking about dates (which is something that is not fully in their hands as these hasn't yet been approved) and even making some reckless statements about when we would be 'back to normal' (which is an idea that clashes with the efforts of so many people, institutions and governments to insist on not being too overconfident yet).

MonkeyBot16,"I just happen to work in clinical research, so I think that your comment just shows prejudice.
And I stick to my last comment, that one you don't seem to like.

It's based on an opinion (that might be as biased as any other, including yours) but also based on the facts I've been observing so far in my experience.

Is it normal (even reasonable, ethic...) that a company makes a press release saying 'we found out our product has an effectivity of X%', then another company says 'our product has an effectivity of X+2% and then the first company hits back saying 'so now we've seen our effectivity is X+5%'? Is it normal or reasonable? I don't think so.
Is it common? I don't think so, I haven't seen such a thing, so far. This is a commercial war, has very little to do with science as far as I'm concerned. Science speaks with hypothesis and facts, not through press statments which people has to believe just based on faith.

If the data had gone on the other direction, would have they rushed to update that number in just a matter of days? I highly doubt it. They would have waited, and they would have kept gathering more data. At some point, they would obviously need to release their conclussions, but nothing is written about having to update every single finding at real time. Nobody does it, and these same companies haven't been doing that when it was not convenient for their interests. That's a fact.

Specifically, there are huge limitations in the design of both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines which makes them not as promising as some people might be willing to believe. And the press is generally failing to explain this properly. I haven't seen any effort from these companies to clarify any of these points and stick to the truth; on the contrary, I've read interviews of some of the people involved on some of these trials that were just feeding hopes (again on the basis of pure faith until they release the data).

The fact that this has happened to you or you have seen similar things in the past doesn't make it acceptable or good per se, neither it means everyone involved in research is happy with this way of doing things.
As I said, I believe this puts the whole sector in jeopardy and contributes to feed misbeliefs and distrust in science in general.
From 1950 to recent times, bioethics has been an evolving field of research and health care, improving the care of the patients and volunteers, providing more and better information, more robust consents.... Recently, it seems that corporate interests are trying to take advantage of the situation to make it go backwards.

I may write too much (we all have our flaws), but if I do is because I believe in giving arguments to expose my ideas and because this is something I feel passionate about.
Research pays my salary but I haven't any money invested on it (as you said you have), so we might have completely different (even opposed) visions about it.

It is a fact that some people have already made a fortune in the stock market following all these announcements. It might be legal, it might be in accordance to the rules of the game, but I firmly believe this is immoral in the current situation.

As a matter of fact, I think we will never be able to fully defeat this pandemic if the economic interest of the big pharma companies are to prevail over other considerations. A global effort should be made for the best vaccines to be fairly distributed worldwide. I'm aware there have been some initiatives, but I feel they are insufficient and the media is (conciously or not) doing the dirty job for the corporate interests above the common interest.

MonkeyBot16,"It might depend a lot on the brand, model, etc...of the freezer; as well on how old it is, is in good shape? how much empty space there is into it?...

But based on my experience, if a freezer fails, it will take around 2h (more or less depending on different variables) to go above -70ºC, and from that point is quite likely that the integrity of the samples (vaccine in this case) would be lost.

And you don´t even need to picture a catastrophic scenario to consider how this samples/vaccines could be spoiled. For instance, if you keep the door of an ultra-low freezer at -80ºC for 45seconds, you will most likely have a temperature excursion above -70ºC.  
So, the problem is not only in terms of shipping the vaccines and storing them, well trained staff might be required if you don´t want hundreds of thousands of vaccines being spoiled at the same time just because someone open the door for too long while grabbing a dose of the vaccine. Even the way these vaccines are deposited should be carefully planned and carried out following some specific procedures.

It's not abnormal to keep samples at ultra-low temperature in clinical research, actually this is one of the most common means of long-term storage and it allows for the trials to be reproducible. But it is quite common, too, that this is an aspect that has been commonly overlooked and has been done without following the best practices. Biobanks have an increasingly important role in clinical research, but they struggle to survive and they have to face a lot of problems so far.  
And that only referring to their role focused on clinical research. Now, we would be facing at a challenge of a scale never seen.

It is not impossible, tho, but it would require a huge effort and an even larger investment of money and resources. So, if a government was about to decide which vaccine is the most suitable, all these additional costs and planning efforts should be taken into account, as if they are overlooked it could lead to invest a crazy amount of money in a vaccine that would be eventually spoiled inside a freezer.",1606246422,,gdh4duj,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcrldx7,1606250173,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

lovememychem,"So first: mutation is possible, especially on the long-term scale; if that happens, then we’ll make a new vaccine and adjust, should be way faster the second time. It’s unlikely to be a mutation that immediately forms a new pandemic with no warning or opportunity to form a vaccine; mutations are a natural thing and we know how to monitor.

There’s a few points re: side effects down the line. I could go into the biological details of why it’s unlikely (and I’m happy to do that if you’re interested) but there’s a few simpler points as welll. So first, that’s basically unheard of — the vast, vast, vast majority of side effects occur within 60 days of vaccination, which is why the FDA set that as their setpoint for how much safety data they need on average before they’ll even *consider* an application for an EUA. Second, even if the vaccine did cause problems 5, 10, 20, 30 years down the line (and again — that’s extraordinarily unlikely), there’s no way of knowing that now and running the trials even longer isn’t going to tell us that either. Basically, it’s a problem that is so unlikely to occur that it’s not worth worrying about, and even if it *was* a problem, we wouldn’t have any way of figuring that out anyways, so it’s really not an area where we should be focusing our efforts and resources — mental or otherwise.

Again, I can go into the biological details of why those problems are even less likely with these particular vaccines, but let me put it this way: as someone that’s a current MD/PhD student and has spent a solid amount of time reading about this, I will have zero hesitation about getting my vaccine.

(Except for the actual injection itself, but that’s only because I *hate* needles :-) )

Oh and I’m not sure what you’re referring to when you ask what if the vaccine doesn’t work (that’s what the phase III trials have actually been testing), but if the vaccine makes everyone asymptomatic... problem solved!

To clarify; friend was very ill (staple signs of covid. Thought he had the flu), we hung out, and then me and my roommate got very ill 13 days afterwards. 

Right now, the only reason I can rather accurately say it’s covid instead of a cold is because I’ve had a lot of experience with respiratory illnesses. I’ve had coughs from bad RSV to really bad asthma to everything in between. This cough isn’t like one I get from the a cold or the flu. It hurt; a lot. It was the first time I had actually been afraid of dying since I had RSV 20 years ago. I guess your body doesn’t forget that fear.

The other big thing that made me mostly certain covid; loss of smell/taste. I’ve never had such a... lack of taste. I’ve had it where food just tastes bad because of congestion; but it’s such a total lack of taste it’s almost surreal. 

There’s very little doubt in my mind that it isn’t covid.

Godvivec1,"&gt; By that I mean there is no actual long term evidence on how this affects a human being after 5, 10, 20 years and that’s not data that you can just simply make up

So you want them to get 20 years worth of data before giving out the vaccine. That sounds like holding it in the closet for 20 years to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  but what exactly is that telling me of how the concoction of ingredients is going to react in my body.

Research. The information is out there. Though I don't have a list of ingredients for the upcoming vaccines, I can pretty much assume they'll use the same delivery systems that most other vaccines use. Shouldn't be to hard to find scientific, peer-reviewed, research on the effects of the vaccines, and delivery systems for the vaccine. You can google, right now, Flu vaccine ingredients and find a plethora of resources breaking down every single ingredients, and what it is, and what specifically it does to your body.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I gave a source and its up to you wether you want to read what manipulation is going on right now or choose to take the Vaccine 

To put it bluntly, your source is garbage. It's one mans anecdotal evidence, and it's about smudging numbers to meet an agenda, not about the vaccine. 

It's also sad that you don't actually understand how science works. The vaccine isn't going to just get released with a ""Hey, this is the government! This works, take it!"".

The vaccine's studies and findings will be, and are being currently, independently peer-reviewed. ANY manipulation, or smudged numbers, will be discovered pretty fast. You can wait for a few independent studies to come out to make up your mind, I would understand that. But, that won't be that long after the vaccine is ready, if any time at all.

That allows you to skip steps that you'd usually take. Usually, you wouldn't immediately enrol 40.000 people into your vaccine trial, because those things are expensive. If you have a say HPV treatment, you'll start smaller to get results that can justify the expense of bigger trials. And that takes time.

MonkeyBot16,"Twitter might not be the best source to get informed about this, but I quite agree with many of those statements.

Besides the reasonable prudence we should all have when facing press releases made by the pharma industry and the fact that relevant data has not even been shared yet; I think there's an objective reason that would make both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines not very attractive for any government to invest millions in it atm:

The way these studies have been designed, they are not checking with periodical PCRs if the volunteers are infected or not. They've just tested the ones that presented sympthoms. So, basically, it has to be assumed that there is a lot of asympthomatic people that has been failed to be detected in those fantastic %s they have been providing.  
So, these 2 vaccines would most likely prevent the development of some of the (probably the milder) symptoms of the disease, but they won´t stop the person to get infected, neither to spread the infection in most of the cases. In other words, they won´t be enought to stop the spread of the disease in a substantial way and, taking this into account, it wouldn´t be too reasonable to let them cut corners at this point to deploy the vaccine before their results are published and peer-reviewed, specially with the data of age groups and so.

Personally, I think it would be very short-minded to rush to buy the 1st vaccine that is approved just because it's the first, if there are strong roots to think that a better one would be released in a matter of a few months.  
I can understand the pressure to try to make the current situation a little bit more tolerable, but with 'not good enough' vaccines, we are not going to be able to make it.

And considering that in most of places, the elderly and most vulnerable people are meant to receive the vaccine first (as well as the health workers, etc..), it would be extremely important to be sure about the possible benefits vs adverse events of these vaccines, as the volunteers for these studies are usually healthy people.",1606249526,,gdhayed,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqmljj,1606253933,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx
MonkeyBot16,"That is something that should never happen, specially during transport.

These kind of materials, that require such specific temperatures, are shipped with temperature recording devices/dataloggers. So if the temperature goes beyond the right limits, it would be recorded and the people who receive the shipment would be able to check it.

The units where this vaccines would be stored (ideally ultra low temperature freezers) should include temperature recording devices (internal or external) so any excursion could be recorded, too.If so, the most critical point might be those moments when the vaccines are being moved from one container to another or pulled into a freezers, as you cannot track their temperature while they are 'on the air'; so this should be done as fast as possible and following a proper protocol.

The facilities that store clinical samples (biobanks or labs) at ultra low temperature usually have redundant empty freezers (at least the ones that follow the good practices) to be able to transfer the whole content of a freezer to one of the empty ones in the event that it fails.

Technically it is perfectly possible and well known, but it's not as easy as some people might think or some might suggest. The issue is that it will require a huge amount of resources to be able to scale up an infrastructure like this for the numbers that are required.

This might be one of the main problems that a requirement like this might present: you don't need only the proper equipment and infrastructure, but also properly trained staff to be sure the vaccines will be handled correctly.

If the costs exceed the benefits, I think it would be fair to question if it would even worth a try, when it's expected that there will be more suitable alternatives soon.

MonkeyBot16,"Most of vaccines so far can be stored at -20ºC (a pretty regular freezer) or above, so it's not  the same scenario at all.

The problem is not the distribution of the vaccine to the place they are meant to be stored first. In fact, Pfeizer has suggested they would take care of this (so I'm assuming they would even cover the costs if there's a problem with a lot at that stage)

The problem is the storage and distribution to the 'vaccination spots' from that point.

The dry ice containers sound a little bit like a delusional idea. They might be perfect for transport and distribution, but not for long-term storage.Dry ice sublimates into the air, so you cannot just dump these containers in any place as you could eventually get high concentrations of CO2 in that environment if it's not well ventilated. They cannot be perfectly sealed as the pressure would start to increase until the container eventually explote.Even the process of refilling with dry ice could be problematic as if it is not properly carried out or designed, the vaccines could be exposed to higher temperatures in the process.

So, the obvious device to store this vaccines for the mid-long-term would be ultra-low temperature freezers. They would require physical space, a good temperature monitoring system, trained staff and a constant power supply.So, this would be probably one of the most critical bottlenecks: to what extent would the hospitals or clinics be able to inoculate the vaccine at a pace fast enough, considering clinical staff and hospitals are currently almost collapsed in many places.On the meantime, a sufficient supply of vaccines would need to be stored somewhere, and a container filled with dry ice is not a good idea at all (it would for the shipment, but not as much for the storage itself).

If all the logistics would be already quite complex in the 'rich' countries that already have a preexistant infrastructure to build from, the 'poor countries' would be in a really weak position to be able to store this vaccine.",1606248232,,gdh87vg,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcwiips,1606252363,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

MonkeyBot16,"I just happen to work in clinical research, so I think that your comment just shows prejudice.
And I stick to my last comment, that one you don't seem to like.

It's based on an opinion (that might be as biased as any other, including yours) but also based on the facts I've been observing so far in my experience.

Is it normal (even reasonable, ethic...) that a company makes a press release saying 'we found out our product has an effectivity of X%', then another company says 'our product has an effectivity of X+2% and then the first company hits back saying 'so now we've seen our effectivity is X+5%'? Is it normal or reasonable? I don't think so.
Is it common? I don't think so, I haven't seen such a thing, so far. This is a commercial war, has very little to do with science as far as I'm concerned. Science speaks with hypothesis and facts, not through press statments which people has to believe just based on faith.

If the data had gone on the other direction, would have they rushed to update that number in just a matter of days? I highly doubt it. They would have waited, and they would have kept gathering more data. At some point, they would obviously need to release their conclussions, but nothing is written about having to update every single finding at real time. Nobody does it, and these same companies haven't been doing that when it was not convenient for their interests. That's a fact.

Specifically, there are huge limitations in the design of both Pfeizer and Moderna vaccines which makes them not as promising as some people might be willing to believe. And the press is generally failing to explain this properly. I haven't seen any effort from these companies to clarify any of these points and stick to the truth; on the contrary, I've read interviews of some of the people involved on some of these trials that were just feeding hopes (again on the basis of pure faith until they release the data).

The fact that this has happened to you or you have seen similar things in the past doesn't make it acceptable or good per se, neither it means everyone involved in research is happy with this way of doing things.
As I said, I believe this puts the whole sector in jeopardy and contributes to feed misbeliefs and distrust in science in general.
From 1950 to recent times, bioethics has been an evolving field of research and health care, improving the care of the patients and volunteers, providing more and better information, more robust consents.... Recently, it seems that corporate interests are trying to take advantage of the situation to make it go backwards.

I may write too much (we all have our flaws), but if I do is because I believe in giving arguments to expose my ideas and because this is something I feel passionate about.
Research pays my salary but I haven't any money invested on it (as you said you have), so we might have completely different (even opposed) visions about it.

It is a fact that some people have already made a fortune in the stock market following all these announcements. It might be legal, it might be in accordance to the rules of the game, but I firmly believe this is immoral in the current situation.

As a matter of fact, I think we will never be able to fully defeat this pandemic if the economic interest of the big pharma companies are to prevail over other considerations. A global effort should be made for the best vaccines to be fairly distributed worldwide. I'm aware there have been some initiatives, but I feel they are insufficient and the media is (conciously or not) doing the dirty job for the corporate interests above the common interest.

MonkeyBot16,"It might depend a lot on the brand, model, etc...of the freezer; as well on how old it is, is in good shape? how much empty space there is into it?...

But based on my experience, if a freezer fails, it will take around 2h (more or less depending on different variables) to go above -70ºC, and from that point is quite likely that the integrity of the samples (vaccine in this case) would be lost.

And you don´t even need to picture a catastrophic scenario to consider how this samples/vaccines could be spoiled. For instance, if you keep the door of an ultra-low freezer at -80ºC for 45seconds, you will most likely have a temperature excursion above -70ºC.  
So, the problem is not only in terms of shipping the vaccines and storing them, well trained staff might be required if you don´t want hundreds of thousands of vaccines being spoiled at the same time just because someone open the door for too long while grabbing a dose of the vaccine. Even the way these vaccines are deposited should be carefully planned and carried out following some specific procedures.

It's not abnormal to keep samples at ultra-low temperature in clinical research, actually this is one of the most common means of long-term storage and it allows for the trials to be reproducible. But it is quite common, too, that this is an aspect that has been commonly overlooked and has been done without following the best practices. Biobanks have an increasingly important role in clinical research, but they struggle to survive and they have to face a lot of problems so far.  
And that only referring to their role focused on clinical research. Now, we would be facing at a challenge of a scale never seen.

It is not impossible, tho, but it would require a huge effort and an even larger investment of money and resources. So, if a government was about to decide which vaccine is the most suitable, all these additional costs and planning efforts should be taken into account, as if they are overlooked it could lead to invest a crazy amount of money in a vaccine that would be eventually spoiled inside a freezer.",1606246422,,gdh4duj,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcrldx7,1606250173,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

lovememychem,"So first: mutation is possible, especially on the long-term scale; if that happens, then we’ll make a new vaccine and adjust, should be way faster the second time. It’s unlikely to be a mutation that immediately forms a new pandemic with no warning or opportunity to form a vaccine; mutations are a natural thing and we know how to monitor.

There’s a few points re: side effects down the line. I could go into the biological details of why it’s unlikely (and I’m happy to do that if you’re interested) but there’s a few simpler points as welll. So first, that’s basically unheard of — the vast, vast, vast majority of side effects occur within 60 days of vaccination, which is why the FDA set that as their setpoint for how much safety data they need on average before they’ll even *consider* an application for an EUA. Second, even if the vaccine did cause problems 5, 10, 20, 30 years down the line (and again — that’s extraordinarily unlikely), there’s no way of knowing that now and running the trials even longer isn’t going to tell us that either. Basically, it’s a problem that is so unlikely to occur that it’s not worth worrying about, and even if it *was* a problem, we wouldn’t have any way of figuring that out anyways, so it’s really not an area where we should be focusing our efforts and resources — mental or otherwise.

Again, I can go into the biological details of why those problems are even less likely with these particular vaccines, but let me put it this way: as someone that’s a current MD/PhD student and has spent a solid amount of time reading about this, I will have zero hesitation about getting my vaccine.

(Except for the actual injection itself, but that’s only because I *hate* needles :-) )

Oh and I’m not sure what you’re referring to when you ask what if the vaccine doesn’t work (that’s what the phase III trials have actually been testing), but if the vaccine makes everyone asymptomatic... problem solved!

MonkeyBot16,"It has to be thawed before being injected, obviously. It wouldn´t be only unreasonable to introduce something at those temperatures in the human body, it would also cause great harm to the tissues and could be dangerous.

The key of this is that above -70ºC, degradation will start, but it won´t be something that will just happen in an instant. This is obviously something that the producer has already taken into account, otherwise the vaccine would be absolutely useless.

The issue is mostly how to ensure the cold chain at all stages before the vaccine is thawed to be injected.  
If a lot or a shipment is eventually exposed to -60ºC for a very short period of time, the integrity of those vaccines could be still not totally bad and it might still be effective... But this is really hard to measure and the effects (in terms of giving an ineffective lot of the vaccine to a large number of people) could be relevant.  
And this is not something that would affect only a few vials, as they would be sent and stored in large numbers.

The other challenge that the cold chain pose is that if you have a relevant temperature excursion (let´s say above -50ºC), this could lead to the formation of crystals when the temperature is back to -80ºC.  
Freeze&amp;thaw cycles are usually terrible in terms of keeping the integrity of biological samples or similar.

Even if it was true, it might be common, but it´s not normal at all and it should raise a lot of concerns. I think that clinical research is going towards a very dangerous direction. Fortunately, not all the companies and institutions have taken the same approach, but the visibility in the media atm the is focused on these ones.  
We should learn from historical precedents, as the reputational damage caused to clinical research and health care in the long-term could be catastrophic and could translate in loss of credibility, reputational damage and a decrease of partipants for clinical trials.  
From my point of view, the greed and selfishness of a few is jeopardizing one of the main pillars of human development.

These rushed press releases, this public confrontation... is fueling up the stupid ideas of those who dimiss scientific knowledge and question the 'vaccination' itself as a concept.  
What will happen if the hype created these days is then not supported by results? More people will fall into nihilistic nonsensical ideas, refulsal to get vaccinated will be empowered...

Skepticism and prudence have been some of the qualities that have guided research for years. Faith-believing and big words have not much to do with it; it's pure marketing... at the expense of the scientific credibility.

Precedents re. other drugs might have worked on a different way. At the moment, there's a hugle pressure from most of the society wordwide to try to find something that will ease the current situation, even a little bit. This is a great opportunity for business for those who have few or non ethical concerns, but a sensitive person would try to stay prudent not to feed false expectations.  
And unfortunately, media attention hasn't been recently so focused on these issues so far. So, the companies that are rushing to make this announcements are perfectly aware of the consequences of this. If things don't go as well as expected, they would have made a fortune anyways, but the damage for the whole society would be beyond repair for a really long-term.

It would be naive to think that the economic side of research and the development of new drugs is irrelevant; but there are different ways of doing things.

Additionally, it would be fair to ask: do these companies make so loud statements to announce when their trials fail to achieve their objectives (as the stakeholders would have the same right to know)? I think we all know the answer.",1606250993,,gdhe1go,False,t3_jweif7,t1_gcqpbm5,1606255688,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Finding studies to prove vaccines are not good for you wont happen because they need to be heavily funded and cooperation needs to occur.  Imagine you own a product and an independent group under funded wants YOU to pay for our provide products to test to prove safe.  Guess what you are going to do?  make sure your product is in top shape, that you polish those that seem to like you and push out the ones looking to prove your product stinks.    

Anytime you are injecting something into your body, chemicals and other 'things', you have a risk your body wont be able to push that away.

Hashimoto's disease is a much more common thyroid disease today.  It's becoming known in some studies that vaccine materials can get into the thyroid and will be treated for life like a threat to the body and as such the bodies immune system constantly attacks the thyroid causing this disease.  It's a terrible disease for many, yet mysterious and growing exponentially.

hyprsloth,"I think it's safe to say that anti vaxers will be in line for this if proven effective as the alternative is more dire than what vaccines have been proven countless times to cause as it pertains to side effects and other items still being studied and squashed.   I had a friend die from the flu vaccine.  A healthy person.  That flu vaccine absolutely had ZERO ability to stop the flu strains going around that year, yet they were forced to take it by their employer.   The children sued the employer and won and it wasnt hard.

I wouldnt call myself an anti vaxer but I certainly wouldnt subject myself or my family to vaccines that are of dubious intent or effectiveness.  In this case, covid concerns outweigh potential side effects however I will 'wait awhile' like many others to see what it does to others.

95% effective, says a large pharma that stands to make billions (or at least regain their losses in research and dev on this.  How exactly is that tested?  I tried to search and in my limited time came up empty but will continue.  Do they test 95% against the fact that out of 100 people only 5 got covid?  Well that's actually NOT a good number if the participants are social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding going out etc like everyone else is (or should be).  If 5 people out of 100 at your business caught covid even though they did everything they were supposed to, you and your co workers would be demanding for safer work conditions right?
