ShannonKayG,"Worth reading:

&gt;Paywalls, which require a paid subscription (or access via university enrollment), block access to scientific research and make a significant amount of money doing so. The paid publishing of these articles is a multibillion-dollar industry with top publishers boasting a profit margin between 35-40%.

&gt;The articles are priced at a rate far too expensive for the average consumer, oftentimes upwards of $50 each. Schools and universities are forced to spend millions per year for subscriptions to these archives.
The cost of subscribing to academic research journals has risen by 300% above inflation since 1986, while academic library budgets have risen by only 79% over that time.

&gt; What further aggravates this issue is that the public pays for much of this research in the first place. The federal government allocates $140 billion annually to research and development, meaning taxpayers are funding the research and then having to pay to view the findings.

&gt;The dangers of this system have become increasingly apparent in recent weeks due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the immediate need for access to any and all coronavirus research that is available.

&gt; Valuable information is being hidden from those in developing countries who desperately need access to every single resource available. 

&gt;Seeing this as a monumental concern, a modern-day Robin Hood went to work to break through the paywalls and open up access to the bounty of coronavirus research online.

&gt; One Reddit user who goes by the name of “Shrine” found it absurd that thousands of studies on the coronavirus were hidden behind paywalls and accessible only to those who could afford them.

&gt;“I realized that there were people dying and that the death rate could be higher as a result of a lack of access to the articles,” explains Shrine, who preferred to remain anonymous.
“Any little piece of information that we can glean from previous scientific research on pandemics, epidemics, viruses, or vaccines has suddenly become relevant and agencies all over the world need access to all of these articles.”

&gt;Shrine found and illegally downloaded more than 5,000 coronavirus research papers created from 1968 through 2020, using a website called “Sci-Hub.” He then released all of the articles on Reddit and within hours had thousands of seeders accessing the research.

&gt; Attempting to make his vigilante operation legitimate, Shrine tried to appeal directly to the publishing companies themselves by creating a petition on Change.org asking them to remove the paywalls in order to help individuals and organizations research the coronavirus.

&gt; The petition got hundreds of signatures within a few days and was successful in increasing the amount of coronavirus research papers available online from just a few thousand to over 32,000.

&gt;Shrine’s efforts continued with a petition to the International Organization of Standards that effectively released paywalled information to help engineers build ventilators, as of April 9th.

&gt;While Shrine’s Reddit post was obviously illegal, he believes the practice of hiding valuable information behind expensive paywalls is what’s really unethical. Recent history also points to the danger of these paywalls during times of crisis.

Omnitraxus,"The papers are, but the journals they're published in aren't. There is a lot of overhead associated with the process of peer review and publishing, and those costs are divided between the people who want access - which isn't a huge group of people. Thus the costs being high.

There's probably a better way to handle this, but the process of peer review is more important than ever in today's age of junk science and fake news.

I'd also be interested to see how much of an impediment the journal access fees are to legitimate research and treatment - virtually all academic institutions and research firms have subscriptions, and it's likely amateurs sitting at home who understand maybe half of what's in the paper that ""benefit"" from this most.

elementzer01,"Thanks u/Shrine! Doing Aaron Swartz proud!

For those who haven't read it, The Guerilla Open Access Manifesto by Aaron Swartz, a Reddit co-founder:

&gt;Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.

&gt;There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost. 

&gt;That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. 

&gt;""I agree,"" many say, ""but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal - there's nothing we can do to stop them."" But there is something we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back. 

&gt;Those with access to these resources - students, librarians, scientists - you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not - indeed, morally, you cannot - keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends. 

&gt;Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends. 

&gt;But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral - it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy. 

&gt;Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it - their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies. 

&gt;There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture. 

&gt;We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access. 

&gt;With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge - we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?

JupiterXX,"Am reviewer and don’t get paid. There is one number that is missing from most people’s calculation. Depending on the journal, they may take only a small fraction of peer reviewed papers and even those are often reviewed multiple times, so there is a lot of paperwork and hours of coordinating reviewers involved. We can be a bit busy and forgetful and etc. it’s a job I would not want in a million years. So that is definitely a cost to keep the manpower to enable peer review. I have no idea what kind of staffing would needed however and I tend to agree that the fees were maybe more suited to actual paper publishing and that these days publishers are just taking advantage.

elementzer01,"Thanks u/Shrine! Doing Aaron Swartz proud!

For those who haven't read it, The Guerilla Open Access Manifesto by Aaron Swartz, a Reddit co-founder:

&gt;Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.

&gt;There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost. 

&gt;That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. 

&gt;""I agree,"" many say, ""but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal - there's nothing we can do to stop them."" But there is something we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back. 

&gt;Those with access to these resources - students, librarians, scientists - you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not - indeed, morally, you cannot - keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends. 

&gt;Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends. 

&gt;But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral - it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy. 

&gt;Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it - their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies. 

&gt;There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture. 

&gt;We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access. 

&gt;With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge - we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?

The more I think about this the less sense it makes.

The publishing isn't expensive either. It used to be...when it was paper.  Putting a few thousand words on the internet is about as cheap as can be. Text is surprisingly small. The bandwidth demands aren't high because as you yourself just said...there isn't a huge group of people who want it.

The whole journal system is built on authors paying insane prices to publish their articles in open access (if your institution can pay the fee, good for you, but just stop and think about the insane publication bias in favor of the 0.1% of universities this creates), otherwise people who are just researching the existing literature have to pay a double digit fee just to **view** one article (and if the abstract wasn't enough to ascertain whether this is relevant to your research, good luck!) or go through the university's library (and again, heaven forbid if your university doesn't have a contract with every single fucking publisher), logging in and authenticating every time you want to access a paper. You'll have to repeat that process for what, 100 papers just to select which ones you'll use to provide background and supplement the discussion of your own manuscript?

Oh, and if you finally get published after half a year of processing and back and forth with the reviewers, the motherfuckers will periodically ask you to peer review for free.

The whole journal system is built on authors paying insane prices to publish their articles in open access (if your institution can pay the fee, good for you, but just stop and think about the insane publication bias in favor of the 0.1% of universities this creates), otherwise people who are just researching the existing literature have to pay a double digit fee just to **view** one article (and if the abstract wasn't enough to ascertain whether this is relevant to your research, good luck!) or go through the university's library (and again, heaven forbid if your university doesn't have a contract with every single fucking publisher), logging in and authenticating every time you want to access a paper. You'll have to repeat that process for what, 100 papers just to select which ones you'll use to provide background and supplement the discussion of your own manuscript?

WittyYak,"I am going to write imagining that you really would like to know. It's a complex topic, difficult to go through in a Reddit ""comment"". I'll bring up something that I haven't heard emphasized enough focusing a bit on that ""old boys club"".

An important factor is the reputation of a journal holds. I prefer to publish in one of the top 10 journals in my field. All are either Elsevier or Springer. They have long been around, and are obviously reputable. Their editors are well known in the field, their reviewers are also generally knowledgeable. They have high standards. So publishing there, for us, is a good way of saying ""this is quality work"". I assume you also know that these journals are ranked using some metrics. There are also the metrics for researchers that play a role in their career advancement (how many publications do you have in X level journals, how many publications etc).

So when the new kid on the block comes and says, hey ""I just made a journal"", it maybe has 10-20 years until it is accepted by the scientific community as a high quality place to put your work in. So, in a sense, the journal has to prove itself first. Even if it says ""here, I'm going to do everything for free"", not many people will bother.

In my opinion, this forms a part inertia for switching towards more open science. Journals had a bigger role in print days. Right now, they are mostly typesetting and hosting papers while the people do the job for free for them (hence such high revenues). Even their ""level of being nice"" is insufficient if you ask me. I wrote a book chapter for instance a few years ago. If I want a digital copy of that book, Springer sells it to me at 20% discount because I'm an author in it... And the price of the book is rather high. So, none of us has the book that we've put together for Springer.

So what do I personally do? I make preprint version of all my work available to everyone through free sites such as Researchgate. Basically, these are the unformatted papers that were peer reviewed and accepted. I write whichever journal published it on top of the paper, so I get over the reputation issue that way (e.g.,preprint of: bla bla). Whoever wants nice typesetting and has 30+ dollars lying around per article, or has a university agreement, can download the journal version from the journal. Distributing pre-prints is usually legal by the way. It also shows that a website can perfectly host these things without charging anyone.

The entire process of publishing is a bit long to explain and give better insight. I think one really needs to be in it to see the entirety it. However, I can say that at this point no devil's advocate is needed. The devil is already powerful enough to fend for itself. What we need is to come up with a better system to solve this problem but it's not a very clear cut path. The EU initiative to have papers open access is quite good for example. However, to make your work open access,   one of my journals asks for an extra 2 monthly paychecks of a PhD holder at my institution.",1586951363,,fnh0grb,False,t3_g1imo3,t1_fngxa2v,1586967960,5,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

tiktock34,"Well its a super complex discussion most on reddit don't want to dive into but it circles around funding.  Many articles in part are funded by tax-paid research.  As such they are or should be published in a way that the people who funded them get access.  Thats its own rabbit hole as there are about 8 kinds of open access licenses with varying nuances as to what you can do with the articles.  The next quagmire comes from authors saying ""i have to pay for access to my own article!"" usually right after they quite literally sign over the rights to that article to those commercial publishers.  There's a significant argument about the ""cost to publish"" and how much profits commercial publishers make, too.  

People around here pretend things like web hosting, advertising, typsetting, proofing, editing, selecting, marketing and putting together a journal, all its financials, all its rights management and such as having no value.  They shake their fist and say things like ""Information should be free"" but would not want to be handed an unverified, un analyzed 20gb dataset and be told ""here's your free data.""

The crux is that the money that funds the research IN those articles doesnt come from the journals.  It largely comes from you and me and taxes paid, which you and I then need to pay to re-gain access to the fruits of that research.

Forget arguments on whether a company in France should be granted free access to US taxpayer-funded research.  That is a whole other mess.",1586960422,,fnhdpb2,False,t3_g1imo3,t1_fnhbyv0,1586976115,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

If you're using it strictly for personal reference, it's unlikely to ever be discovered. If you're referencing or sharing it in a business environment, make sure you go through the correct channels.

Morally speaking, laws were, at least in the US, essentially designed to be broken through the underlying constitutional structure that empowers/enables them. It was realized very early on that laws need to adapt and change in time to accommodate social structure with very few exceptions to that design. As many of our current legal structures exist, they're more and more designed strictly to benefit furthering wealth inequality and anticompetitive behavior utilized by large businesses and the very wealthy. Many shouldn't exist, many need reasonable modification. There's money grabbing at every stage of the process and this is fundamentally publicly funded research that should be available to the general public.

MagnificoReattore,"&gt; The journal/issue format might be obsolete but readers are still accessing research at article level.  

I agree with you on this, in the case of outreach journals is especially true. I feel like the article format has some pros, such as giving a standardized format and avoiding a mess, but also many cons, for example if you want to present visualization of data, printing on paper is limiting compared to the tools that are available now.

&gt;I just wanted to point out that some publishers have had the paywall down on all COVID research for a month now.
It’s very easy to make publishers the “bad guys” in this situation and there are certainly some that deserve that title, but that’s not the case for all.  

I think that taking down the paywall for a month is only a patch and not a solution. I'm not saying that they are ""evil"", just that a for profit model is not the best if your goal is the open sharing of scientific knowledge.

&gt;The work of a publisher is not only administrative. A publisher offers the editorial expertise and strategy to develop every journal within their discipline. They help journals grow by providing more outreach via marketing and promotion and, in turn, the communities also grow around this platform.

Yes, but I feel like this could be done better by an international agency, accessible to everyone.

&gt;It is obvious that the subscription model is starting to become obsolete, but this is not a change that can be done so quickly and easily. Open Access is more of a reality everyday (read about Plan S).

Yeah, I really appreciate that EU is moving in the direction of Open Access. But I am aware that it is difficult to transition to a different model. The editor main asset is that it can be trusted to give an objective judgment on the quality of the material it published. It can be difficult to build that trust from scratch and to make people accept a new publishing agency as standard. Only a coordinated action, possibly stimulated by EU, can make this transition possible.

&gt; However, there are a lot of complicated factors around this move, particularly the fact that some academic/practitioner societies are solely funded by subscriptions to their journals. It is important to point out that, when taking away subscriptions, the publisher is not the only one that gets hurt.  

I was not aware of this, could you make some examples? Interesting.

It considered 4% of papers were congruent with man made climate change, 3% refuted it. The rest of the studies were unrelated. Therefore 3% disagree right? Still published in newspapers after al gore quoted it. The authors of the 4% disagreed. My wife has a masters in environmental science and she explained to me so my story is a bit second hand.  Then you have the whole gmta/smtas etc controversy of using anomaly data, which chiefly used is NASA data who do not publish methodology, and use a biased baseline.

MagnificoReattore,"&gt; The journal/issue format might be obsolete but readers are still accessing research at article level.  

I agree with you on this, in the case of outreach journals is especially true. I feel like the article format has some pros, such as giving a standardized format and avoiding a mess, but also many cons, for example if you want to present visualization of data, printing on paper is limiting compared to the tools that are available now.

&gt;I just wanted to point out that some publishers have had the paywall down on all COVID research for a month now.
It’s very easy to make publishers the “bad guys” in this situation and there are certainly some that deserve that title, but that’s not the case for all.  

I think that taking down the paywall for a month is only a patch and not a solution. I'm not saying that they are ""evil"", just that a for profit model is not the best if your goal is the open sharing of scientific knowledge.

&gt;The work of a publisher is not only administrative. A publisher offers the editorial expertise and strategy to develop every journal within their discipline. They help journals grow by providing more outreach via marketing and promotion and, in turn, the communities also grow around this platform.

Yes, but I feel like this could be done better by an international agency, accessible to everyone.

&gt;It is obvious that the subscription model is starting to become obsolete, but this is not a change that can be done so quickly and easily. Open Access is more of a reality everyday (read about Plan S).

Yeah, I really appreciate that EU is moving in the direction of Open Access. But I am aware that it is difficult to transition to a different model. The editor main asset is that it can be trusted to give an objective judgment on the quality of the material it published. It can be difficult to build that trust from scratch and to make people accept a new publishing agency as standard. Only a coordinated action, possibly stimulated by EU, can make this transition possible.

&gt; However, there are a lot of complicated factors around this move, particularly the fact that some academic/practitioner societies are solely funded by subscriptions to their journals. It is important to point out that, when taking away subscriptions, the publisher is not the only one that gets hurt.  

I was not aware of this, could you make some examples? Interesting.

Real answer: we have an asshole of a governor bought out by tourism and cruise interests. Tourism is how we make most of our money.

So imagine a governor finds out exactly what *not* to do in this situation, and does it anyway, purely because doing so will be better for tourism. He's talking about reopening schools for fuck's sake!!!

So that mentality leads to -- if we have a coronavirus problem here then people won't vacation here. But we can't have positive cases it we don't test!!!

While there is OBVIOUSLY community spread, the criteria are still ""Have you been to China, Italy, South Korea, or Iran?"" Or else you can't get a test.

We have tested less than 150k as of this morning... We have over 22 mil population.

It's bad. And as for hospitals? They started asking for donations of hand-sewn masks weeks ago, although it varies from hospital to hospital; some are not allowing staff that come into contact with Covid patients to wear homemade ones.

(I know someone who works in the hospital by me.)

One last thing: I live near a hospital network. I have gone from hearing sirens maybe once a day to multiple times day and night -- as I started to type this, a siren started blaring in the distance. Obviously, I can't claim that they are all Covid-related ... But I've lived here for a while and never have I ever heard so much activity around the hospitals by me.

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask whatever you'd like",1586640306,,fn4fh3r,False,t3_fzdovx,t1_fn4bt24,1586640308,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

We have tested less than 150k as of this morning... We have over 22 mil population.

It's bad. And as for hospitals? They started asking for donations of hand-sewn masks weeks ago, although it varies from hospital to hospital; some are not allowing staff that come into contact with Covid patients to wear homemade ones.

(I know someone who works in the hospital by me.)

One last thing: I live near a hospital network. I have gone from hearing sirens maybe once a day to multiple times day and night -- as I started to type this, a siren started blaring in the distance. Obviously, I can't claim that they are all Covid-related ... But I've lived here for a while and never have I ever heard so much activity around the hospitals by me.

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask whatever you'd like",1586640306,,fn4fh3r,False,t3_fzdovx,t1_fn4bt24,1586640308,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

SmurfUp,"A few months ago, a motorcyle wreck happened maybe 20 yards in front of me. He slammed into a turning truck at about 50 mph, flew up in the air, and hit the ground. I pulled over and it took me about ten seconds to get out of my car to help because I had this weird feeling of not processing it until it kicked in and I ran over to help. Once more cars pulled up and stopped at the scene, I looked up from where I was crouched next to the biker where I was trying to keep him calm while calling 911, and everyone was just standing next to their cars watching.

It was the strangest thing and I really didn't understand at the time why no one else was helping; a nurse pulled up after a couple minutes and ran over to help, but everyone else was just standing there and even when I yelled for them to help no one moved until I actually singled people out and asked them to do things. I don't blame them because it seems a lot of people react like that, but that was the first time I saw in person that a lot of people sort of freeze up in times of crisis even when they can see someone badly injured in front of them.",1586650143,,fn4vxq4,False,t3_fzdovx,t1_fn4n309,1586650145,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

SmurfUp,"A few months ago, a motorcyle wreck happened maybe 20 yards in front of me. He slammed into a turning truck at about 50 mph, flew up in the air, and hit the ground. I pulled over and it took me about ten seconds to get out of my car to help because I had this weird feeling of not processing it until it kicked in and I ran over to help. Once more cars pulled up and stopped at the scene, I looked up from where I was crouched next to the biker where I was trying to keep him calm while calling 911, and everyone was just standing next to their cars watching.

It was the strangest thing and I really didn't understand at the time why no one else was helping; a nurse pulled up after a couple minutes and ran over to help, but everyone else was just standing there and even when I yelled for them to help no one moved until I actually singled people out and asked them to do things. I don't blame them because it seems a lot of people react like that, but that was the first time I saw in person that a lot of people sort of freeze up in times of crisis even when they can see someone badly injured in front of them.",1586650143,,fn4vxq4,False,t3_fzdovx,t1_fn4n309,1586650145,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

My wife and I share opposite concerns right now for each other. She’s worried about me because I still have to drag ass to work and serve people who can’t follow fucking safety rules endangering all of us because I’m “essential”(‘Murcia). I HAVE to work because I support my wife and daughter who are stuck living in the Philippines right now. So I’m covering everything so I can’t just NOT work. She’s worried I’ll get sick since I’m a very underweight dude who usually gets sick easily from the throat. Now I’m worried about her because although she’s relatively safe from the virus where she’s at specifically right now, getting supplies/money is getting more difficult and it stresses the hell out of me.

Absolutely.  Did you know over 1 million children starve to death in India every year.  I'll say that again: ""every year"".  You can Google that, it is crazy.  And the USA farmers would be glad, hell we would be ECSTATIC to sell them food!  It turns out the little children can't afford the food, so we just let those little kids starve.  F--k anybody who can't pay for food, and that includes anybody inside the USA.  

Starvation in the USA will certainly not be because of a lack of food.  In the Great Depression there was plenty of food.  The issue is some people won't be able to pay for the food, so they don't get the food.  Like the people who starved to death in the Great Depression -&gt; they didn't have the cash money to purchase calories, so they starved to death.

I get it, it sucks. I'm not working right now becuase of this virus, but honestly, fuck the economy. There are 300 million people in the US and at a rate of 10% hospitalization rate, if everyone was infected, that's 30 million in the hospiatal, at which half of which will probably die.

I get the feeling from being here at Reddit that most of the people who visit the Coronavirus forum are generally educated about this illness but I think there is such a huge percentage of people in our society that only know the basics and some percentage that barely know the basics. It would only take some of those people naively engaging in unsafe practices at church to mess everything up, even if leaders had the best of intentions to social distance. 

Most of the people on my Facebook feed seem to take the approach of tuning away from news and just waiting for the government and other leaders to fix it. I don't think a lot of people actually want to hear about it and while that is completely understandable I think it puts people at risk because they aren't getting the latest information about what means we need to take to be safe. For example, a pastor might make sure each church members is six feet apart but we know that 6ft actually isn't fully sufficient now  as news in the last few says has communicated that.

In my personal brand of Christianity the commandments, the deadly sins, and the works of mercy are basically a lump sum of my beliefs. I don’t understand how you can argue against someone who follows those three things because in my opinion they are 98% of what you need to be a good person. 

Yea, I like the idea of being forgiven for my mistakes. But I don’t know anyone that doesn’t. I like the tradition of it, knowing my family has done it for over a thousand years.

Um okay. What do you think groceries are made out of? 


&gt;"" it's not based on any science,"" Chapman said. A better way to handle new groceries is to put them away and then wash your hands with soap and water, or use hand sanitizer, Chapman said. 

Right and then ten seconds later my 4 year old is going to reach into the pantry, grab the peanut butter jar, touch his face and every surface in my home and then touch my face all before you can say coronavirus. Same with the apples and bananas and lemons and avocados. 

His point is that it is ""probably"" not on food and that ingesting virus probably won't give it to you. But why have items in your house that at least the cashier if not other customers have recently handled? 

I'll use my own logic and knowledge to ignore this article and other experts. I'm sure 4 days from now there will be a different cdc recommendation.

pjoshyb,"This may be true and I am not condoning the stupid actions of this church, however continued legal action would be a very tough battle for the government considering a few particular rights to assemble and religion, even if they went the public safety route.  Then you also have people playing around the edges of other rights such as the police chief in Seattle telling residents to call 911 if you hear someone say racial slurs during the pandemic.  People shouldn’t say racist slurs but they do have the right to say them and there would be quite the uproar if anyone was charged for their speech, vile or not. The ensuing conversation about rights that will come about after all of this is over is going to be interesting.  


Bottom line is people need to stop being stupid and quit causing issues like this in the first place.  Stay home people.

They think they decide and understand better than other believers. A bigger theory is they’re victims of the prosperity gospel. They think that because they’re Christian nothing bad can happen to them because they’re worshipping. That’s wrong. Just because you believe in God didn’t mean nothing bad will happen to you.

https://www.cbs58.com/news/heres-a-look-at-what-states-are-exempting-religious-gatherings-from-stay-at-home-orders

&gt;Kentucky makes an exemption for life-sustaining business and religious organizations that provide ""food, shelter, social services, and other necessities of life"" for people disadvantaged or in need because of the pandemic. However, the organizations must social distance as much as possible, including ending in-person retail.

The handful of churches that held services claimed exemption under that order.",1586742037,,fn8hx4h,False,t3_g03smi,t1_fn8gtyw,1586742039,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

How is deliberately endangering the lives of your neighbors an act of Christianity?

Also, when Satan dared Jesus to leap from the cliff, because surely God would send angels to catch him, rather than let him be injured, Jesus replied ""thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.""

As a Christian, surely you believe that God is omnipotent, therefore he has set this highly contagious plague on humanity for a reason. Good sense would indicate that God intends for his followers to isolate themselves so that they might survive this plague, rather than gather in large groups that will enhance it's spread.

Christians who insist upon meeting in large groups are defying God, and daring him to strike them down.

Dr_puffnsmoke,"So if your PTSD is endangering others, you absolutely need treatment. but if said PTSD is causing you injure others, you’re still in the wrong, even if we understand the cause.

Example, if you get PTSD with fireworks and go to a fireworks show. Then proceed to punch the guy next to you at the show, you’re still guilty of assault. And it really begs the question of why you went to that fireworks show in the first place given your condition. I’m not saying I’m not sympathetic but the world isn’t responsible for your conditions. You are responsible for finding an appropriate way to navigate it. If it’s a loud noise triggered PTSD, maybe avoid places with fireworks. Maybe invest in some good noise canceling headphones or a white noise machine for home. Likewise if you have some psychologic issue preventing mask wearing maybe look into alternative coving products (like those beekeeper helmets or a face shield) or maybe just consider ordering delivery or having a friend or family member get your items. Because one thing is for sure, the world isn’t changing for you so you need to find a way to operate in it.

Edit: so as a second example,if a father has mental health issues and it results in violent mood swings that result in him beating the shit out of his wife and/or kids. Are we now saying that we should be sympathetic to his plight or work to accommodate his mental health issue? We might be able to diagnose it and understand why he acts the way he does but I don’t think that it justifies his behavior. He should seek help and we as a society should encourage that help and try to make getting help as easy as possible but ultimately it’s on him to get better, not us to accept his current behaviors.",1595554412,1595589467.0,fz1mjbh,False,t3_hwoez0,t1_fz1lltq,1595622365,12,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

They got there with widespread mask use, strict lockdowns, contact tracing, social distancing, people following the science on how to prevent spread, and keep it there by doing sensible things like social distancing, contact tracing, true quarantines for positives, and masks. My friends in Australia, which had very strict lockdowns, say they can now pretty much go about business as usual. They can do that because their daily new cases was in the teens and twenties (and now back in lockdown in Melbourne because they spiked above 100). 

We basically did none of those things. NYC got hit hard so we did a passable lockdown and got numbers down. But there was no national plan for what to do once we got infections under control. Masks will help greatly, and it’s something we each can control and help make happen.

IdHiketh4t,"I think we are talking about two different things. If someone has a legitimate medical condition that impacts breathing and oxygen levels (which, pulmonologist say does not include asthma), then that’s different and this is their attempt at doing something to contain their droplets. But, current medical advice is to stay home if you have any of the conditions known to impact your ability to breathe and get optimum levels of oxygen in because those are the same conditions that make a covid diagnosis high risk and life threatening to you (emphysema, COPD, etc...).

Medical documentation and studies done recently using actual clinically measured oxygen levels and respiration rates show that many many people can wear a mask and not show any dip in oxygen levels even over hours long and while walking, activity, etc. They are actually investigating this and taking it into consideration and all the evidence based research shows that even for someone on supplemental oxygen with a nasal cannula, surgical masks or home made fabric masks are NOT impeding oxygenation. Now, if you’re talking the form fitting respirator or medical grade non surgical level 1 masks meant to protect the person wearing via droplet filtration, those might have a measurable  impact based on increased effort required to pull air in and push air out of the filter.

The majority of people with their nose out are doing it to try and give the middle finger to the requirement because they “have a mask on” (albeit improperly) so they “meet the entry requirements for the establishment”. Or because it’s cooler temp and easier blah blah.

Air travel is the only way to get there. You’re right, flying is terribly risky for him (more so than others since his world is so small right now). His whole team of doctors and therapists are working to find ways to minimize the need for travel. But he will need to go sometimes. The equipment needed just doesn’t exist here. There are quite a few kids that we are working with mask compliance on. Nearly all of them see specialists in Anchorage. But it wouldn’t threaten their life not to see those specialists for awhile and hopefully their doctors will get around the timing laws somehow and they will still get their meds. Any one of them could have another unexpected health problem happen though, and have to fly. But this kids issues are more significant and they do threaten his life (if untreated). So it’s a cost/benefit thing. I’m just not OK with thinking we need to sacrifice this kids health or life because we can’t make a necessary exception when, all around the country people are eating and drinking in bars and restaurants with no mask. I think there are a whole host of riskier activities that we are absolutely allowing. The times this would be needed is minimal and would not be the tipping factor here.

I’m pretty sure you would also bite someone who was holding something on your face and you felt threatened by it. That would be the only way to get him to keep that mask on for a flight. He doesn’t understand why it’s necessary. I have never ever once said that wearing a mask is in any way dangerous. Just that some people can’t wear them. There’s a big difference. He has been kept at home, since March. He’s lost a lot of function as a result, very sad but unavoidable. He won’t be returning to school when other kids do because his health issues put him in a very high risk category. Flying from a place with 0 active cases to Anchorage, with community spread is not appealing at all. But the choice is to possibly risk his health by flying, or to definitely risk his health by having no access to procedures he needs to remain healthy. It sucks. He has sacrificed everything and has no clue why his life has had to change this way. And now, sorry, nothing can be done, guess he might just have to die then. Meanwhile everyone else gets to do to the damn bar without a mask and party it up. This way of thinking is JUST AS BAD as the people who are prancing around whining about masks violating their constitutional rights. He should have equal access to medical treatment as anyone else does. This kid has actually had to sacrifice his freedoms, his education, and most things that he enjoys and will continue to do so until it’s safe for him. But I guess it’s the expectation that he sacrifice his life as well. Geez. I could even maybe understand that if people will equally as upset and trying to do something about the things that actually are causing major spread. It just sucks that people are abusing the medical excuses because that’s why the airlines are having to make these rules. My point is that there should be exceptions made for real cases. Toughen it up by all means. Make it really hard to get past the requirement. People who actually have that need will not have a hard time proving it, people who are abusing it would. I hate those assholes for ruining it. Just like I hate people with emotional support lizard for making life for people who really need service dogs life much harder. I hate antivaxers for putting people who actually can’t get vaccinations at risk. This is the same.

Illustrious_Bobcat,"My youngest is autistic. He 4, but mentally around 2. I can't get him to wear a mask. He doesn't understand and I'm pretty sure the feel of the mask is causing sensory overload. Nothing I say can convince him because the ability to comprehend the meaning just isn't there. Very rarely, he'll wear one for a short time if everyone else is, but the moment it becomes in any way uncomfortable, that's it. 

This all being said, it's why he hasn't left home since March besides a move (old house to new one), and 2 necessary doctor's visits. 

I'm a large advocate for autism awareness and the idea that there is no way to fairly expect an autistic person to always be able to act in a socially expected way, so this kind of situation tickles that concern.  But why put them in that situation to begin with when it's a pandemic? 

I support this choice. I'm not a fan of how they always handle it (AA is infamous for treating customers like crap anyway), but it's necessary for the health of others.

I've got two elderly ladies who live in my home, both high risk. My DS7 is starting virtual schooling Monday to protect them. The kids don't leave the house to protect them. I don't leave unless absolutely necessary to protect them. Hubby is essential, so his exposure is enough risk for us.

heres another flatten the curve thing, what do you know, its wider. it's almost like you filter the information you dont like out, or just dont know how to read a graph. you saying it would be gone by now if we flattened the curve is my pet peeve because just look at all the graphics.

&gt;It is likely that eventually it will become endemic, and most of us will get infected. But one question is super important: How long will it take for that to happen? If it happens in a few months, every hospital will be overwhelmed and people will not be treated for coronavirus or other diseases. If it happens that fast, it will be an unprecedented disaster. However, if we do our best in terms of prevention by practicing social distancing, reducing travel, not going to work when we’re sick, we could slow spread of the disease. If the same 60-70% infection of the global population is spread over 3 years, then hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, people can get treated, and we have time to develop a vaccine—it’s a completely different story.The difference between it happening fast or slow is potentially the difference between a 1918 flu level event and a bad flu season level event. We have control over that.

jimni_walker,"Most children are exempt anyway, especially at 4 years old. My son is autistic as well, high functioning but severe. He's 24 years old though functional in some ways of about a 10 year old. He completely understands about the pandemic and is terrified of getting it. He cant wear a mask either  due to sensory issues and panics and feels like he cant breathe although is mostly just hyperventilating. However he chooses not to go into stores because of it because he knows the danger of this virus, not because I have told him or tried to scare him but because he can read and he educated himself on it. He is like a 10 year old in social and emotional ways, but he's not unintelligent. 

That being said I do understand there are plenty of reasons why a disability can prevent someone from wearing a mask, and that is not the issue. The issue is people claiming they have a disability as an excuse not to wear a mask, and trying to use the ADA as a weapon to scare employees and business owners into letting them get in without a mask on.

The lack of solid communication makes it hard to tell, but it's either a sensory trigger or simply not understanding WHY. Sometimes I can get him to wear one for a small amount of time if I can get him excited about Mommy wearing a mask too, even better if Daddy comes with us and has one as well. He feels included. But as soon as it gets uncomfortable in any way, it comes off.

So I don't take him anywhere right now. He's been out of the house on a trip only 3 times since March. The first was because we moved, so he went from our old house to the new one. The second and third were both doctor visits. One to catch up on missed vaccines due to this nightmare, the other because he's my ER baby and likes to try to off himself on a regular basis. This time he needed x-rays on his leg. He was fine. 

But otherwise, neither of my kids are out in public. They hate it and don't understand, the 4 year old much more so than the 7 year old who is neurotypical and can understand a bit more why... Though even he doesn't completely get it.

We start 100% virtual schooling on Monday. Not only to protect them, but to protect my mother and MIL who live with us and are very high risk. Hubby is essential personnel, so that's enough risk as it is...",1597354958,,g1dhpic,False,t3_hwoez0,t1_fz1j28b,1597362496,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Illustrious_Bobcat,"My youngest is autistic. He 4, but mentally around 2. I can't get him to wear a mask. He doesn't understand and I'm pretty sure the feel of the mask is causing sensory overload. Nothing I say can convince him because the ability to comprehend the meaning just isn't there. Very rarely, he'll wear one for a short time if everyone else is, but the moment it becomes in any way uncomfortable, that's it. 

This all being said, it's why he hasn't left home since March besides a move (old house to new one), and 2 necessary doctor's visits. 

I'm a large advocate for autism awareness and the idea that there is no way to fairly expect an autistic person to always be able to act in a socially expected way, so this kind of situation tickles that concern.  But why put them in that situation to begin with when it's a pandemic? 

I support this choice. I'm not a fan of how they always handle it (AA is infamous for treating customers like crap anyway), but it's necessary for the health of others.

I've got two elderly ladies who live in my home, both high risk. My DS7 is starting virtual schooling Monday to protect them. The kids don't leave the house to protect them. I don't leave unless absolutely necessary to protect them. Hubby is essential, so his exposure is enough risk for us.

heres another flatten the curve thing, what do you know, its wider. it's almost like you filter the information you dont like out, or just dont know how to read a graph. you saying it would be gone by now if we flattened the curve is my pet peeve because just look at all the graphics.

&gt;It is likely that eventually it will become endemic, and most of us will get infected. But one question is super important: How long will it take for that to happen? If it happens in a few months, every hospital will be overwhelmed and people will not be treated for coronavirus or other diseases. If it happens that fast, it will be an unprecedented disaster. However, if we do our best in terms of prevention by practicing social distancing, reducing travel, not going to work when we’re sick, we could slow spread of the disease. If the same 60-70% infection of the global population is spread over 3 years, then hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, people can get treated, and we have time to develop a vaccine—it’s a completely different story.The difference between it happening fast or slow is potentially the difference between a 1918 flu level event and a bad flu season level event. We have control over that.

jimni_walker,"Most children are exempt anyway, especially at 4 years old. My son is autistic as well, high functioning but severe. He's 24 years old though functional in some ways of about a 10 year old. He completely understands about the pandemic and is terrified of getting it. He cant wear a mask either  due to sensory issues and panics and feels like he cant breathe although is mostly just hyperventilating. However he chooses not to go into stores because of it because he knows the danger of this virus, not because I have told him or tried to scare him but because he can read and he educated himself on it. He is like a 10 year old in social and emotional ways, but he's not unintelligent. 

That being said I do understand there are plenty of reasons why a disability can prevent someone from wearing a mask, and that is not the issue. The issue is people claiming they have a disability as an excuse not to wear a mask, and trying to use the ADA as a weapon to scare employees and business owners into letting them get in without a mask on.

Like you, most people with a disability or with a family member with a disability are concerned enough about the virus to stay home or severely limit our, or the disabled persons exposure, not getting up in others faces and screaming about HIPAA and the ADA and screaming about ""MAH RIGHTS!""",1597409756,,g1fqibm,False,t3_hwoez0,t1_g1djz85,1597409767,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Illustrious_Bobcat,"Same.  My youngest is 4, but he's autistic, so mentally around 2ish. There are times when he flat out refuses to wear a mask. The lack of solid communication makes it hard to tell, but it's either a sensory trigger or simply not understanding WHY. Sometimes I can get him to wear one for a small amount of time if I can get him excited about Mommy wearing a mask too, even better if Daddy comes with us and has one as well. He feels included. But as soon as it gets uncomfortable in any way, it comes off.

So I don't take him anywhere right now. He's been out of the house on a trip only 3 times since March. The first was because we moved, so he went from our old house to the new one. The second and third were both doctor visits. One to catch up on missed vaccines due to this nightmare, the other because he's my ER baby and likes to try to off himself on a regular basis. This time he needed x-rays on his leg. He was fine. 

But otherwise, neither of my kids are out in public. They hate it and don't understand, the 4 year old much more so than the 7 year old who is neurotypical and can understand a bit more why... Though even he doesn't completely get it.

We start 100% virtual schooling on Monday. Not only to protect them, but to protect my mother and MIL who live with us and are very high risk. Hubby is essential personnel, so that's enough risk as it is...",1597354958,,g1dhpic,False,t3_hwoez0,t1_fz1j28b,1597362496,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Wearing a mask may can affect how you breathe. You might find yourself taking shallow breaths, or even holding your breath. This can cause you to breathe in more carbon dioxide, which can cause headaches and nausea.

heres another flatten the curve thing, what do you know, its wider. it's almost like you filter the information you dont like out, or just dont know how to read a graph. you saying it would be gone by now if we flattened the curve is my pet peeve because just look at all the graphics.

&gt;It is likely that eventually it will become endemic, and most of us will get infected. But one question is super important: How long will it take for that to happen? If it happens in a few months, every hospital will be overwhelmed and people will not be treated for coronavirus or other diseases. If it happens that fast, it will be an unprecedented disaster. However, if we do our best in terms of prevention by practicing social distancing, reducing travel, not going to work when we’re sick, we could slow spread of the disease. If the same 60-70% infection of the global population is spread over 3 years, then hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, people can get treated, and we have time to develop a vaccine—it’s a completely different story.The difference between it happening fast or slow is potentially the difference between a 1918 flu level event and a bad flu season level event. We have control over that.

heres another flatten the curve thing, what do you know, its wider. it's almost like you filter the information you dont like out, or just dont know how to read a graph. you saying it would be gone by now if we flattened the curve is my pet peeve because just look at all the graphics.

&gt;It is likely that eventually it will become endemic, and most of us will get infected. But one question is super important: How long will it take for that to happen? If it happens in a few months, every hospital will be overwhelmed and people will not be treated for coronavirus or other diseases. If it happens that fast, it will be an unprecedented disaster. However, if we do our best in terms of prevention by practicing social distancing, reducing travel, not going to work when we’re sick, we could slow spread of the disease. If the same 60-70% infection of the global population is spread over 3 years, then hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, people can get treated, and we have time to develop a vaccine—it’s a completely different story.The difference between it happening fast or slow is potentially the difference between a 1918 flu level event and a bad flu season level event. We have control over that.

adherentoftherepeted,"&gt;It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: ‘if you’re so smart why ain’t you rich?’ There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register. 

&gt;Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times.

I also worked under, I *think*, UFCW - I can't remember since it was so long ago, but they were covering a local independently owned grocery store. Anyway, they did literally nothing for me - never met a union rep, made basically minimum wage, nepotism was still rampant in the store, and there were no protections for hours, workplace conditions, or anything like that.

Reneeisme,"$100,000 is practically the poverty line in the San Francisco bay area.  Salaries are higher, because living expenses are higher. There's more involved than how much someone earns.  It's just not that simple.  But I absolutely agree that many people are over-extended and could live more within their means.  For the sake of this argument, it doesn't really matter what they ""could"" be doing though.  It matters what they have done.  Because that's what's going to determine their situation and their behavior now.  

And it's worth remembering that our economy depends on that over-extension to such a degree that we've encouraged it.  Banks made (and continue to make, despite the recent crises) home loans that people can't afford.  Cars get sold with zero down, and loans made for them to people already in over their heads credit wise.  Credit card offers come to people who've already maxed out every card they own.  Blaming people for over-extending themselves is a bit like blaming an alcoholic for being one.  Are they responsible?  Absolutely.  Is it realistic to think they can just stop doing it on their own, or won't end up in a bad situation if it's too easy to make that choice?  Probably not.  We allow credit companies to prey on people's desires and ignorance to facilitate the over-extension most of them find themselves in.  Couple that with the huge numbers of people who actually don't make enough to live on, and you arrive at the situation we're in today, where most of the population is in serious trouble the moment the economy falters.",1595436881,,fyw000v,False,t3_hvmw0r,t1_fyvy9qj,1595506881,7,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

mtbizzle,"Folks have said this mess has unmasked a lot of problems. I'm not going to disagree. What is the cost of not having mandated, robust paid sick leave?? 

Think about the **incentives**. If you are not getting paid, or *might* not get paid while off due to concern of illness, many many people will not take off. Many will **downplay** their symptoms in their own mind to make them more comfortable doing what they have to do - go to work, take care of the family. 

That's the exact opposite behavior you want, but it's what's incentivized. And any interaction with the healthcare system could be really costly so many will avoid that unless absolutely necessary. 

I see this stuff all the time. I've see patients talk about how they essentially blew off shortness of breath and continued to go about their business at stores etc. I've heard doctors imply they're not a fan of fever checks at the hospital because being sent away due to testing high temperature means no shift and less pay. 

There are some companies with great policies, and sometimes it's probably more of a culture issue than a policy issue. But in general the incentives and disincentives leave me with little faith that 99 out of 100 times people will ""do the right thing"" and self quarantine when they are symptomatic. Which in practice means you assume everyone in a hotspot region has it and behave accordingly. GA Tech modeling estimated that in a random collection of 10 people in my county 55% chance that one or more have it.

For the sake of this argument, it doesn't really matter what they ""could"" be doing though.  It matters what they have done.  Because that's what's going to determine their situation and their behavior now.  

And it's worth remembering that our economy depends on that over-extension to such a degree that we've encouraged it.  Banks made (and continue to make, despite the recent crises) home loans that people can't afford.  Cars get sold with zero down, and loans made for them to people already in over their heads credit wise.  Credit card offers come to people who've already maxed out every card they own.  Blaming people for over-extending themselves is a bit like blaming an alcoholic for being one.  Are they responsible?  Absolutely.  Is it realistic to think they can just stop doing it on their own, or won't end up in a bad situation if it's too easy to make that choice?  Probably not.  We allow credit companies to prey on people's desires and ignorance to facilitate the over-extension most of them find themselves in.  Couple that with the huge numbers of people who actually don't make enough to live on, and you arrive at the situation we're in today, where most of the population is in serious trouble the moment the economy falters.",1595436881,,fyw000v,False,t3_hvmw0r,t1_fyvy9qj,1595506881,7,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

mtbizzle,"Folks have said this mess has unmasked a lot of problems. I'm not going to disagree. What is the cost of not having mandated, robust paid sick leave?? 

Think about the **incentives**. If you are not getting paid, or *might* not get paid while off due to concern of illness, many many people will not take off. Many will **downplay** their symptoms in their own mind to make them more comfortable doing what they have to do - go to work, take care of the family. 

That's the exact opposite behavior you want, but it's what's incentivized. And any interaction with the healthcare system could be really costly so many will avoid that unless absolutely necessary. 

I see this stuff all the time. I've see patients talk about how they essentially blew off shortness of breath and continued to go about their business at stores etc. I've heard doctors imply they're not a fan of fever checks at the hospital because being sent away due to testing high temperature means no shift and less pay. 

There are some companies with great policies, and sometimes it's probably more of a culture issue than a policy issue. But in general the incentives and disincentives leave me with little faith that 99 out of 100 times people will ""do the right thing"" and self quarantine when they are symptomatic. Which in practice means you assume everyone in a hotspot region has it and behave accordingly. GA Tech modeling estimated that in a random collection of 10 people in my county 55% chance that one or more have it. That's a virtual guarantee of exposure if you are in stores unless you are very careful and mindful about viral load.",1595429887,,fyvlsfq,False,t3_hvmw0r,t1_fyuujay,1595498271,4,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Because that's what's going to determine their situation and their behavior now.

Banks made (and continue to make, despite the recent crises) home loans that people can't afford.  Cars get sold with zero down, and loans made for them to people already in over their heads credit wise.  Credit card offers come to people who've already maxed out every card they own.  Blaming people for over-extending themselves is a bit like blaming an alcoholic for being one.  Are they responsible?  Absolutely.  Is it realistic to think they can just stop doing it on their own, or won't end up in a bad situation if it's too easy to make that choice?  Probably not.  We allow credit companies to prey on people's desires and ignorance to facilitate the over-extension most of them find themselves in.  Couple that with the huge numbers of people who actually don't make enough to live on, and you arrive at the situation we're in today, where most of the population is in serious trouble the moment the economy falters.",1595436881,,fyw000v,False,t3_hvmw0r,t1_fyvy9qj,1595506881,7,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

ViolaNguyen,"&gt; The hit job the right-wing has done on California blows my mind, and as far as taxation is concerned my advice would be to check the actual numbers before saying this is a high taxation state, because progressive taxation and tax brackets don't work the way you think they do.
&gt; 
&gt; Progressive taxation (IMO correctly) targets high wage earners more than regular working people.
&gt; 
&gt; For some (or maybe even most) households, you're taxed more in ""low tax"" states between state and local because they take a fixed % from your paycheck.


Property taxes suck.

They suck less in California than they do in other states (like Texas), but they're basically a regressive wealth tax that hits the middle class and the poor harder than the rich.

One reason I love California is that I can afford to own a house here.  If my house were in Texas, I'd have to worry about being able to afford the taxes.

Income tax?  Sales tax?  I don't care, because by definition I have enough money to pay income tax (and it's not that bad), and I can make my sales taxes as low as I want them to be by spending less.

""Low tax"" states need funding, too, so they just rearrange it to make room for a marketing slogan.  ""Low tax"" just means low income tax.

Quick retirement arithmetic:

Assume $20k per year for health insurance.  If you own a $300k house in Texas, then you might pay $10k in property taxes in retirement.

So, your initial retirement expenses are going to be your cost of living *plus* $30k per year.  If you're obeying the 4% rule (make your retirement funds last by spending no more than 4% per year), you're looking at $750k saved up just to cover the initial taxes and medical expenses.

I got to hold her only a few precious times before we went into lockdown here. But then the fact that I and my husband are immunocompromised and my mother is very high risk kicked in. 

I didn’t touch my daughter or her baby girl for *months*. And I’m annoyingly physically affectionate normally. It fucking sucked. I despise that because of this virus I missed out on a lot and I couldn’t really help my baby girl’s adjustment into her own motherhood. But as she &amp; I agreed, it was better to miss out in the short term in order to not only keep me around long term but my hubby and my mother as well. (I’m the person shopping for 2 households, keeping me healthy keeps the other two healthy too.)

Really awful for my daughter &amp; myself is that my mom adores babies. She’s a baby whisperer. And she cannot hold her great grandchild for who knows how long. But again, keeping her safe short term means she’s around for years to come, ideally. 

I’m sorry your son isn’t being safe. That sucks. Really sucks. But he’s an adult and that’s his prerogative, as yours *must* be to keep yourself safe, even from his choices. Use exactly what you said about being around to love on your family for years to come. Anything that interferes with your being able to do that should get a hard no. No debate, no wishy-washy flexibility. It’s time to break out the mom’s final “No.” with him.

 “Son, I love you, I love my DIL, I love and adore your children. My love isn’t going anywhere, but my body needs to stay safe and that requires distance and masks. I know we don’t agree on the politics here but what matters is *I believe* that my life is at risk in this situation and I love you, your siblings, my grandchildren, our family too much to take any risks. I want to have as much time on this earth as possible to continue loving my family.

$15,000 per year.

I own a house with no mortgage and have minimal other debt, and I still can't afford to retire in the U.S. because of healthcare.

I can move to Malaysia and pay about $1000 per year for the same quality care.  I can move to Panama or Costa Rica and pay even less.

sandiegoite,"&gt; They suck less in California than they do in other states (like Texas), but they're basically a regressive wealth tax that hits the middle class and the poor harder than the rich.

I mostly agree with this. I'm not sure what the better way is...I've heard of things like Georgism that may offer at least a partial solution, but are unlikely ever to get tried.

&gt; ""Low tax"" states need funding, too, so they just rearrange it to make room for a marketing slogan. ""Low tax"" just means low income tax.

I disagree with this slightly, a lot of ""low tax"" states consider fixed percentage income taxes at state and local levels to be low. They aren't low when they apply to every dollar you make especially if you fall into certain income tax brackets. You can actually wind up paying less in California depending upon which tax bracket you fall into.

However, they also do exactly what you're saying and take no income tax, but have very aggressive or regressive taxation models for property. So I think we mostly agree.

Here it is almost the opposite. As the government pays your sick leave outside of the 12 days (it's actually 4x 3 day periods), it is capped at about 70,000$ per year, so that if you have a very high income above what is actually necessary, the government isn't going to keep paying you that.

What I don't understand is how this is even functional or makes any economic sense. I've had my appendix burst at 20 and was out of work for a full month. I got paid for the entire month and paid 0$ for the medical treatment. If I didn't get paid and had to pay an out of pocket cost for the medical treatment as well, I'd really struggle, and I was making 17$ an hour which was the minimum wage - and I still had very little savings (although I must admit I was spending like a drunken sailor at the time). Can't even imagine how I'd get by in the first place had I made 10$ an hour (although costs of living might be higher here).

ViolaNguyen,"&gt; The hit job the right-wing has done on California blows my mind, and as far as taxation is concerned my advice would be to check the actual numbers before saying this is a high taxation state, because progressive taxation and tax brackets don't work the way you think they do.
&gt; 
&gt; Progressive taxation (IMO correctly) targets high wage earners more than regular working people.
&gt; 
&gt; For some (or maybe even most) households, you're taxed more in ""low tax"" states between state and local because they take a fixed % from your paycheck.


Property taxes suck.

They suck less in California than they do in other states (like Texas), but they're basically a regressive wealth tax that hits the middle class and the poor harder than the rich.

One reason I love California is that I can afford to own a house here.  If my house were in Texas, I'd have to worry about being able to afford the taxes.

Income tax?  Sales tax?  I don't care, because by definition I have enough money to pay income tax (and it's not that bad), and I can make my sales taxes as low as I want them to be by spending less.

""Low tax"" states need funding, too, so they just rearrange it to make room for a marketing slogan.  ""Low tax"" just means low income tax.

Quick retirement arithmetic:

Assume $20k per year for health insurance.  If you own a $300k house in Texas, then you might pay $10k in property taxes in retirement.

So, your initial retirement expenses are going to be your cost of living *plus* $30k per year.  If you're obeying the 4% rule (make your retirement funds last by spending no more than 4% per year), you're looking at $750k saved up just to cover the initial taxes and medical expenses.

&gt; ""Low tax"" states need funding, too, so they just rearrange it to make room for a marketing slogan. ""Low tax"" just means low income tax.

I disagree with this slightly, a lot of ""low tax"" states consider fixed percentage income taxes at state and local levels to be low. They aren't low when they apply to every dollar you make especially if you fall into certain income tax brackets. You can actually wind up paying less in California depending upon which tax bracket you fall into.

However, they also do exactly what you're saying and take no income tax, but have very aggressive or regressive taxation models for property. So I think we mostly agree.

whagh,"But it's the poorest people who need it the most? They're the ones who will have problem handling rent, medical bills, etc? Sounds completely flipped upside down and makes no sense at all.

Here it is almost the opposite. As the government pays your sick leave outside of the 12 days (it's actually 4x 3 day periods), it is capped at about 70,000$ per year, so that if you have a very high income above what is actually necessary, the government isn't going to keep paying you that.

What I don't understand is how this is even functional or makes any economic sense. I've had my appendix burst at 20 and was out of work for a full month. I got paid for the entire month and paid 0$ for the medical treatment. If I didn't get paid and had to pay an out of pocket cost for the medical treatment as well, I'd really struggle, and I was making 17$ an hour which was the minimum wage - and I still had very little savings (although I must admit I was spending like a drunken sailor at the time). Can't even imagine how I'd get by in the first place had I made 10$ an hour (although costs of living might be higher here). I've also been out for 6 weeks due to a knee surgery, which was also free and I got paid the whole period. If this happens in the US and you end up bankrupt and homeless or having to relocate, that could possibly force you to quit and be out of work even longer.

whagh,"But it's the poorest people who need it the most? They're the ones who will have problem handling rent, medical bills, etc? Sounds completely flipped upside down and makes no sense at all.

Here it is almost the opposite. As the government pays your sick leave outside of the 12 days (it's actually 4x 3 day periods), it is capped at about 70,000$ per year, so that if you have a very high income above what is actually necessary, the government isn't going to keep paying you that.

What I don't understand is how this is even functional or makes any economic sense. I've had my appendix burst at 20 and was out of work for a full month. I got paid for the entire month and paid 0$ for the medical treatment. If I didn't get paid and had to pay an out of pocket cost for the medical treatment as well, I'd really struggle, and I was making 17$ an hour which was the minimum wage - and I still had very little savings (although I must admit I was spending like a drunken sailor at the time). Can't even imagine how I'd get by in the first place had I made 10$ an hour (although costs of living might be higher here). I've also been out for 6 weeks due to a knee surgery, which was also free and I got paid the whole period. If this happens in the US and you end up bankrupt and homeless or having to relocate, that could possibly force you to quit and be out of work even longer.

Your idea of the American system is spot on, I don't even understand how such a system can exist on accident. Part of me thinks it's completely on purpose.

Social security was fine until congress started stealing from it. The USPS was completely self-sufficient until they were given the ridiculous rule that they had to have their pensions paid for like 100 years in advance. Most welfare programs provide positive economic ROI. The public school system wouldn't be so fucked up if teachers we paid well enough to attract good teachers and schools didn't draw funds from taxes of the surrounding neighborhoods, ensuring that poor kids went to poor schools. 

The power of politicians is *supposed* to be the power of the people. That's obviously been incredibly perverted, but I don't think it's an impossibility. And it's mostly due to the fact that people have been brainwashed into voting against their own interests.

For many of us, that little bit of pie isn’t enough to afford rent, or medication or many of the amenities that dignify our lives. This translates to stress which further translates to disease (seriously, it does, down to the DNA). But even this argument is a distraction in the face of COVID.

The truest outrage is that he wakes up everyday, reads his newspaper, that he also owns, sees the condition of modern day America, sees the mass casualties of COVID, and does fuck all to truly address it, while he continuously accumulates more resources that can be spent in one hundred lifetimes, because the system has defined the more others suffer the more he flourishes. It’s frankly not even about money. It’s about humanity. It’s about having the ability to make a profound, lasting change to the lives of everyone, and choosing not to. 

“Oh but if you were in his shoes you’d do the same” no we wouldn’t. Sociopathy is only a condition because it’s an abnormality. Normal people don’t behave this way.

RandomHuman77,"&gt; You really think that if humanity worked together for once, all the world's universities collaborating, all military spending ceased and redirected towards science and education, war and conflict ceased, all supercomputers and scientists working on solving alzheimers, that we wouldn't solve it any faster than we are now?

Any ideas of how to restructure the entire political and economic systems that govern the planet? Yeah, obviously the world would be a much better place if everyone was focused on solving problems such as climate change and diseases instead of wars, but it's not likely to happen so I don't really see the point in arguing about it. 

The Goldman Sacks leak doesn't even apply to Alzheimer's. The potential treatment for it would involve taking doses of a drug for life, it wouldn't be a one-shot thing. Therefore it would entail huge profits its development, so the barriers for this specific disease are not purely economic or political. The government also funds a lot of research into this disease for academic labs.

&gt; More work, more data. How do you get that work? Money. Money = work = data. More money, more work, more data.

Have you heard of something called diminishing marginal returns? You can't keep pouring money into a specific avenue of research and expect equal returns, eventually you would reach a point where placing more money into it would not be efficient. 

&gt; I think you're under the illusion that the people involved in researching cures for these infamous illnesses actually want to find the cure.

I mean I have worked for a drug development company, and I know that I'm not under an illusion because what you are saying is lacking any nuance whatsover. Pharma companies do want to develop drugs since developing them would mean higher profits. 

The economic structures that govern the development of drugs and other therapies are certainly messed up. There are diseases that don't receive any attention because it would not lead to profits. Another example is development of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is expected to kill 150k people per year by 2050 since industry has pretty much given up on developing new ones since it's not a profitable avenue of research.

So again, I am under no illusions about the barriers to progress caused by politics, but you don't seem to be knowledgable enough about this topic to grasp its nuances.",1605552811,,gcit5s2,False,t3_jv5mem,t1_gciog6z,1605612293,6,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

“All the people he’s expected to take care..” going to stop it right there. No one is expecting him specifically to take care of anyone. The outrage is that the system allowed him to own so much of the pie, and that for the many who literally built his wealth, be it from delivery drivers to plant workers, to the people who live in the cities and states that gave him the tax breaks to allow his business to expand, to you and I who pay taxes that fund the roads and infrastructure he used to generate his wealth. For many of us, that little bit of pie isn’t enough to afford rent, or medication or many of the amenities that dignify our lives. This translates to stress which further translates to disease (seriously, it does, down to the DNA). But even this argument is a distraction in the face of COVID.

The truest outrage is that he wakes up everyday, reads his newspaper, that he also owns, sees the condition of modern day America, sees the mass casualties of COVID, and does fuck all to truly address it, while he continuously accumulates more resources that can be spent in one hundred lifetimes, because the system has defined the more others suffer the more he flourishes. It’s frankly not even about money. It’s about humanity. It’s about having the ability to make a profound, lasting change to the lives of everyone, and choosing not to. 

“Oh but if you were in his shoes you’d do the same” no we wouldn’t. Sociopathy is only a condition because it’s an abnormality. Normal people don’t behave this way.

Any ideas of how to restructure the entire political and economic systems that govern the planet? Yeah, obviously the world would be a much better place if everyone was focused on solving problems such as climate change and diseases instead of wars, but it's not likely to happen so I don't really see the point in arguing about it. 

The Goldman Sacks leak doesn't even apply to Alzheimer's. The potential treatment for it would involve taking doses of a drug for life, it wouldn't be a one-shot thing. Therefore it would entail huge profits its development, so the barriers for this specific disease are not purely economic or political. The government also funds a lot of research into this disease for academic labs.

&gt; More work, more data. How do you get that work? Money. Money = work = data. More money, more work, more data.

Have you heard of something called diminishing marginal returns? You can't keep pouring money into a specific avenue of research and expect equal returns, eventually you would reach a point where placing more money into it would not be efficient.

I mean I have worked for a drug development company, and I know that I'm not under an illusion because what you are saying is lacking any nuance whatsover. Pharma companies do want to develop drugs since developing them would mean higher profits. 

The economic structures that govern the development of drugs and other therapies are certainly messed up. There are diseases that don't receive any attention because it would not lead to profits. Another example is development of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is expected to kill 150k people per year by 2050 since industry has pretty much given up on developing new ones since it's not a profitable avenue of research.

“All the people he’s expected to take care..” going to stop it right there. No one is expecting him specifically to take care of anyone. The outrage is that the system allowed him to own so much of the pie, and that for the many who literally built his wealth, be it from delivery drivers to plant workers, to the people who live in the cities and states that gave him the tax breaks to allow his business to expand, to you and I who pay taxes that fund the roads and infrastructure he used to generate his wealth. For many of us, that little bit of pie isn’t enough to afford rent, or medication or many of the amenities that dignify our lives. This translates to stress which further translates to disease (seriously, it does, down to the DNA). But even this argument is a distraction in the face of COVID.

The truest outrage is that he wakes up everyday, reads his newspaper, that he also owns, sees the condition of modern day America, sees the mass casualties of COVID, and does fuck all to truly address it, while he continuously accumulates more resources that can be spent in one hundred lifetimes, because the system has defined the more others suffer the more he flourishes. It’s frankly not even about money. It’s about humanity. It’s about having the ability to make a profound, lasting change to the lives of everyone, and choosing not to.

Any ideas of how to restructure the entire political and economic systems that govern the planet? Yeah, obviously the world would be a much better place if everyone was focused on solving problems such as climate change and diseases instead of wars, but it's not likely to happen so I don't really see the point in arguing about it. 

The Goldman Sacks leak doesn't even apply to Alzheimer's. The potential treatment for it would involve taking doses of a drug for life, it wouldn't be a one-shot thing. Therefore it would entail huge profits its development, so the barriers for this specific disease are not purely economic or political. The government also funds a lot of research into this disease for academic labs.

&gt; More work, more data. How do you get that work? Money. Money = work = data. More money, more work, more data.

Have you heard of something called diminishing marginal returns? You can't keep pouring money into a specific avenue of research and expect equal returns, eventually you would reach a point where placing more money into it would not be efficient. 

&gt; I think you're under the illusion that the people involved in researching cures for these infamous illnesses actually want to find the cure.

I mean I have worked for a drug development company, and I know that I'm not under an illusion because what you are saying is lacking any nuance whatsover. Pharma companies do want to develop drugs since developing them would mean higher profits. 

The economic structures that govern the development of drugs and other therapies are certainly messed up. There are diseases that don't receive any attention because it would not lead to profits.

I did a quick search and it seems as though nearly all traceable issues show within 48 hours, most of the rest up to 42 days, and some up to 6 months or a year. So it looks like we would know by now if there were significant problems with the vaccines we have. So if you haven't had issues with other vaccines, the COVID vaccines will likely also be fine. The vaccine injury table for compensation at the link below was what I found, but I'm sure there are plenty more resources that explain things more thoroughly. https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/data/index.html

For me, I'm 27, athletic build, healthy, no comorbidities, etc. So I have excellent chances against COVID. *But there's still a much higher chance for death or permanent damage if I get COVID than if I get the vaccine,* so you can bet your ass I'll be getting the vaccine as soon as I can. I also would prefer to not get it and unknowingly pass it along to someone more vulnerable at the grocery store if I'm asymptomatic. It's up to you to make the choice for whether you'll be first in line, and skepticism is healthy, but you had better not be eating at indoor restaurants, having indoor gatherings with friends/family, or other risky behaviors in the meantime, because there will be people who can't get the vaccine or are lower on the priority list (or even can't afford it, if you're in the US) and it's our job to keep them safe.

Clever_Userfame,"That’s such a great question and I’m really glad you asked it!

“All the people he’s expected to take care..” going to stop it right there. No one is expecting him specifically to take care of anyone. The outrage is that the system allowed him to own so much of the pie, and that for the many who literally built his wealth, be it from delivery drivers to plant workers, to the people who live in the cities and states that gave him the tax breaks to allow his business to expand, to you and I who pay taxes that fund the roads and infrastructure he used to generate his wealth. For many of us, that little bit of pie isn’t enough to afford rent, or medication or many of the amenities that dignify our lives. This translates to stress which further translates to disease (seriously, it does, down to the DNA). But even this argument is a distraction in the face of COVID.

The truest outrage is that he wakes up everyday, reads his newspaper, that he also owns, sees the condition of modern day America, sees the mass casualties of COVID, and does fuck all to truly address it, while he continuously accumulates more resources that can be spent in one hundred lifetimes, because the system has defined the more others suffer the more he flourishes. It’s frankly not even about money. It’s about humanity. It’s about having the ability to make a profound, lasting change to the lives of everyone, and choosing not to. 

“Oh but if you were in his shoes you’d do the same” no we wouldn’t. Sociopathy is only a condition because it’s an abnormality. Normal people don’t behave this way.

RandomHuman77,"&gt; You really think that if humanity worked together for once, all the world's universities collaborating, all military spending ceased and redirected towards science and education, war and conflict ceased, all supercomputers and scientists working on solving alzheimers, that we wouldn't solve it any faster than we are now?

Any ideas of how to restructure the entire political and economic systems that govern the planet? Yeah, obviously the world would be a much better place if everyone was focused on solving problems such as climate change and diseases instead of wars, but it's not likely to happen so I don't really see the point in arguing about it. 

The Goldman Sacks leak doesn't even apply to Alzheimer's. The potential treatment for it would involve taking doses of a drug for life, it wouldn't be a one-shot thing. Therefore it would entail huge profits its development, so the barriers for this specific disease are not purely economic or political. The government also funds a lot of research into this disease for academic labs.

&gt; More work, more data. How do you get that work? Money. Money = work = data. More money, more work, more data.

Have you heard of something called diminishing marginal returns? You can't keep pouring money into a specific avenue of research and expect equal returns, eventually you would reach a point where placing more money into it would not be efficient. 

&gt; I think you're under the illusion that the people involved in researching cures for these infamous illnesses actually want to find the cure.

I mean I have worked for a drug development company, and I know that I'm not under an illusion because what you are saying is lacking any nuance whatsover. Pharma companies do want to develop drugs since developing them would mean higher profits. 

The economic structures that govern the development of drugs and other therapies are certainly messed up. There are diseases that don't receive any attention because it would not lead to profits. Another example is development of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is expected to kill 150k people per year by 2050 since industry has pretty much given up on developing new ones since it's not a profitable avenue of research.

I did a quick search and it seems as though nearly all traceable issues show within 48 hours, most of the rest up to 42 days, and some up to 6 months or a year. So it looks like we would know by now if there were significant problems with the vaccines we have. So if you haven't had issues with other vaccines, the COVID vaccines will likely also be fine. The vaccine injury table for compensation at the link below was what I found, but I'm sure there are plenty more resources that explain things more thoroughly. https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/data/index.html

For me, I'm 27, athletic build, healthy, no comorbidities, etc. So I have excellent chances against COVID. *But there's still a much higher chance for death or permanent damage if I get COVID than if I get the vaccine,* so you can bet your ass I'll be getting the vaccine as soon as I can. I also would prefer to not get it and unknowingly pass it along to someone more vulnerable at the grocery store if I'm asymptomatic. It's up to you to make the choice for whether you'll be first in line, and skepticism is healthy, but you had better not be eating at indoor restaurants, having indoor gatherings with friends/family, or other risky behaviors in the meantime, because there will be people who can't get the vaccine or are lower on the priority list (or even can't afford it, if you're in the US) and it's our job to keep them safe.

I did a quick search and it seems as though nearly all traceable issues show within 48 hours, most of the rest up to 42 days, and some up to 6 months or a year. So it looks like we would know by now if there were significant problems with the vaccines we have. So if you haven't had issues with other vaccines, the COVID vaccines will likely also be fine. The vaccine injury table for compensation at the link below was what I found, but I'm sure there are plenty more resources that explain things more thoroughly. https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/data/index.html

For me, I'm 27, athletic build, healthy, no comorbidities, etc. So I have excellent chances against COVID. *But there's still a much higher chance for death or permanent damage if I get COVID than if I get the vaccine,* so you can bet your ass I'll be getting the vaccine as soon as I can.

It's up to you to make the choice for whether you'll be first in line, and skepticism is healthy, but you had better not be eating at indoor restaurants, having indoor gatherings with friends/family, or other risky behaviors in the meantime, because there will be people who can't get the vaccine or are lower on the priority list (or even can't afford it, if you're in the US) and it's our job to keep them safe.

But if you want to roleplay, I can entertain you a little bit: No, this vaccine is not a live vaccine. Vaccines usually inject you with a dead or severely weakened version of the virus in question to train your immune system and allow it to make the very specific antibodies it needs to efficiently fight off the disease. This, on the other hand, is not a ""live"" virus vaccine, as it actually uses mRNA to allow the bodies to produce the required antibodies on its own, rather than by defeating a dummy virus. Usually I wouldn't really care about anti-vaxxers or simply idiots that don't listen to science or didn't go to school (judging from your message I'd say both are the case) but people not getting such a vaccine may actually put immunocompromised people that can't get it at all in danger, so to put it quite bluntly, if hypothetically speaking a worthless fucking brainless rat like the one you're roleplaying would exist, they'd be a detriment to society because they would put weaker people in useless danger.

But if you want to roleplay, I can entertain you a little bit: No, this vaccine is not a live vaccine. Vaccines usually inject you with a dead or severely weakened version of the virus in question to train your immune system and allow it to make the very specific antibodies it needs to efficiently fight off the disease. This, on the other hand, is not a ""live"" virus vaccine, as it actually uses mRNA to allow the bodies to produce the required antibodies on its own, rather than by defeating a dummy virus. Usually I wouldn't really care about anti-vaxxers or simply idiots that don't listen to science or didn't go to school (judging from your message I'd say both are the case) but people not getting such a vaccine may actually put immunocompromised people that can't get it at all in danger, so to put it quite bluntly, if hypothetically speaking a worthless fucking brainless rat like the one you're roleplaying would exist, they'd be a detriment to society because they would put weaker people in useless danger.

The results for both vaccines come from interim analyses of large clinical studies. In the Moderna study there were 30,000 volunteers. Half got two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart; half got two shots of a placebo on the same schedule.

There were 95 instances of COVID-19 illness among the study participants; only five of those cases were in the vaccinated group. Ninety were in the group receiving the placebo. Of these, there were 11 cases of severe disease. The results indicate the vaccine was inducing the kind of immune response that protects people if they were exposed to the coronavirus.

Vaccines usually inject you with a dead or severely weakened version of the virus in question to train your immune system and allow it to make the very specific antibodies it needs to efficiently fight off the disease. This, on the other hand, is not a ""live"" virus vaccine, as it actually uses mRNA to allow the bodies to produce the required antibodies on its own, rather than by defeating a dummy virus. Usually I wouldn't really care about anti-vaxxers or simply idiots that don't listen to science or didn't go to school (judging from your message I'd say both are the case) but people not getting such a vaccine may actually put immunocompromised people that can't get it at all in danger, so to put it quite bluntly, if hypothetically speaking a worthless fucking brainless rat like the one you're roleplaying would exist, they'd be a detriment to society because they would put weaker people in useless danger.

I’m sure they care about their health and don’t want to get covid, but the ability to breathe comfortably is worth the risk. I’m very fit, I exercise a lot, I have to wear a mask for my work, and have been wearing masks before it was even mandated and I still hate them and have a hard time breathing in them. It’s possible that my body and other people’s bodies react differently to wearing masks.

Vaccine is being rolled out soon, and once enough people get vaccinated masks won’t be used so we won’t need to keep having these same ridiculous mask conversations....thank goodness!",1605596103,,gcl713e,False,t3_jv5mem,t1_gckqpqc,1605660504,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

ArseneJudge,"Woah brother, nice way to step it up! But as I said it's a bit of a wasted effort since nobody would believe such a worthless, brainless cretin could even turn on electronics to type on reddit in the first place. But if you want to roleplay, I can entertain you a little bit: No, this vaccine is not a live vaccine. Vaccines usually inject you with a dead or severely weakened version of the virus in question to train your immune system and allow it to make the very specific antibodies it needs to efficiently fight off the disease. This, on the other hand, is not a ""live"" virus vaccine, as it actually uses mRNA to allow the bodies to produce the required antibodies on its own, rather than by defeating a dummy virus. Usually I wouldn't really care about anti-vaxxers or simply idiots that don't listen to science or didn't go to school (judging from your message I'd say both are the case) but people not getting such a vaccine may actually put immunocompromised people that can't get it at all in danger, so to put it quite bluntly, if hypothetically speaking a worthless fucking brainless rat like the one you're roleplaying would exist, they'd be a detriment to society because they would put weaker people in useless danger.

HOW contagious or how much viral load they pass on to another person is still in question.

CDC's guidance on surface transmission:

&gt;The primary and most important mode of transmission for COVID-19 is through close contact from person-to-person. Based on data from lab studies on COVID-19 and what we know about similar respiratory diseases, it may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this isn’t thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

* **Pre-symptomatic**: Infected with COVID-19, not currently displaying symptoms but end up doing so

* **Asymptomatic**: Infected with COVID-19 and never display symptoms

&gt; Furthermore, among two studies which carefully investigated secondary transmission from cases to contacts, one found no secondary transmission among 91 contacts of 9 asymptomatic cases, while the other reported that 6.4% of cases were attributable to pre-symptomatic transmission.

Based on data from lab studies on COVID-19 and what we know about similar respiratory diseases, it may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this isn’t thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

* **Pre-symptomatic**: Infected with COVID-19, not currently displaying symptoms but end up doing so

* **Asymptomatic**: Infected with COVID-19 and never display symptoms

Kid stated ""I was tested yesterday but the results won't be back until next week.""

What WHO said, or try to say, is that the transmission of asymptomatic individuals, **using this definition**, is rare. See for example, this section from the document:

&gt; Furthermore, among two studies which carefully investigated secondary transmission from cases to contacts, one found no secondary transmission among 91 contacts of 9 asymptomatic cases, while the other reported that 6.4% of cases were attributable to pre-symptomatic transmission.

Fauci and the media, however, have not made this distinction between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic, hence the confusion.

dlerium,"Resellers are a problem, but resellers exist in China too right? Personally I think the major reason is simple lack of supply to begin with.

If 5% of the population in an Asian country regularly wears masks, but 0.1% of the population in the US regularly wears masks, that's already a 5000x difference in daily use rate. For the sake of discussion, let's just assume equal populations. That's 5000x more masks in the supply chain in the Asian country. So when a pandemic hits, yes the supply chain dries up everywhere, but at least there's a lot more masks to go around. Even for those who don't regularly wear masks (as in like daily use), they likely already have a stockpile to contend with high pollution days or when they're sick. Someone who has *some* masks doesn't have to go buy a year's supply of masks all of a sudden. Meanwhile you're going from literally never using masks to having enough masks to last weeks in the US in a population that barely uses masks. The tiny supply in the US dries up in no time.

Mask shortages existed everywhere, but the supply chain recovered in most other countries just like the toilet paper and bottled water supply chain recovered in the US. The reason is because those items are basically normal daily use goods, so just ramping up supply a bit can allow manufacturers to catch up. Similarly, there's only so much bottled water and toilet paper people stockpile before they realize ""yeah I've got way more than enough.""

What it boils down to for me is to make masks a normal thing, just like toilet paper and bottled water. If you're used to using masks, then the supply chain is built up to supply masks. When situations like these hit, your supply chain doesn't have to go from 0 to 100 but instead 50 to 100.",1591822679,,ftmi8ce,False,t3_h0a6a3,t1_ftm7up6,1591836345,3,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

dlerium,"Resellers are a problem, but resellers exist in China too right? Personally I think the major reason is simple lack of supply to begin with.

If 5% of the population in an Asian country regularly wears masks, but 0.1% of the population in the US regularly wears masks, that's already a 5000x difference in daily use rate. For the sake of discussion, let's just assume equal populations. That's 5000x more masks in the supply chain in the Asian country. So when a pandemic hits, yes the supply chain dries up everywhere, but at least there's a lot more masks to go around. Even for those who don't regularly wear masks (as in like daily use), they likely already have a stockpile to contend with high pollution days or when they're sick. Someone who has *some* masks doesn't have to go buy a year's supply of masks all of a sudden. Meanwhile you're going from literally never using masks to having enough masks to last weeks in the US in a population that barely uses masks. The tiny supply in the US dries up in no time.

Mask shortages existed everywhere, but the supply chain recovered in most other countries just like the toilet paper and bottled water supply chain recovered in the US. The reason is because those items are basically normal daily use goods, so just ramping up supply a bit can allow manufacturers to catch up. Similarly, there's only so much bottled water and toilet paper people stockpile before they realize ""yeah I've got way more than enough.""

What it boils down to for me is to make masks a normal thing, just like toilet paper and bottled water. If you're used to using masks, then the supply chain is built up to supply masks. When situations like these hit, your supply chain doesn't have to go from 0 to 100 but instead 50 to 100.",1591822679,,ftmi8ce,False,t3_h0a6a3,t1_ftm7up6,1591836345,3,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

You're also missing an important piece of the logic. Asymptomatic has different meanings based on the context. By definition, it means showing no symptoms.

dlerium,"Resellers are a problem, but resellers exist in China too right? Personally I think the major reason is simple lack of supply to begin with.

If 5% of the population in an Asian country regularly wears masks, but 0.1% of the population in the US regularly wears masks, that's already a 5000x difference in daily use rate. For the sake of discussion, let's just assume equal populations. That's 5000x more masks in the supply chain in the Asian country. So when a pandemic hits, yes the supply chain dries up everywhere, but at least there's a lot more masks to go around. Even for those who don't regularly wear masks (as in like daily use), they likely already have a stockpile to contend with high pollution days or when they're sick. Someone who has *some* masks doesn't have to go buy a year's supply of masks all of a sudden. Meanwhile you're going from literally never using masks to having enough masks to last weeks in the US in a population that barely uses masks. The tiny supply in the US dries up in no time.

Mask shortages existed everywhere, but the supply chain recovered in most other countries just like the toilet paper and bottled water supply chain recovered in the US. The reason is because those items are basically normal daily use goods, so just ramping up supply a bit can allow manufacturers to catch up. Similarly, there's only so much bottled water and toilet paper people stockpile before they realize ""yeah I've got way more than enough.""

What it boils down to for me is to make masks a normal thing, just like toilet paper and bottled water. If you're used to using masks, then the supply chain is built up to supply masks.

&gt;	Advice to decision makers on the use of masks for healthy people in community settings: As described above, the wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks. 

&gt;	The following potential risks should be carefully taken into account in any decision-making process:
• self-contamination that can occur by touching and reusing contaminated mask
• depending on type of mask used, potential breathing difficulties
• false sense of security, leading to potentially less adherence to other preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene
• diversion of mask supplies and consequent shortage of mask for health care workers
• diversion of resources from effective public health measures, such as hand hygiene

No, WHO never *explicitly* recommended that healthy people not wear masks. But I can totally see how you’d walk away with the impression that they would *prefer* healthy people not wear masks.",1591837488,,ftnb4y3,False,t3_h0a6a3,t1_ftmtjdl,1591851571,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

socsa,"Out of all the stuff on this sub, the mask hysteria is the most frustrating bit of revisionist history.  It's an emotional response that people are clinging to, I am convinced.  
  
There are plenty of pages on both the WHO and CDC websites about using masks in these situations.  The narrative that these two institutions ever said ""masks don't work"" is flat out false.  In addition to fears over hoarding, the bigger issue for the CDC and WHO with regards to an official suggestion for the public to specifically wear respirator masks is a fear that people will improperly re-use one or two masks, go about their day, and spread that contamination from mask to hand to surface over and over again.  In reality, those two masks would better be left to medical professionals who are trained in the proper way to re-use masks.   And this has absolutely proven to be an issue.  People are definitely re-using masks in a risky way which makes them vectors for contamination, because they have gotten caught up in the idea of a mask being about individual protection.
  
The entire issue is that this is a fairly complex public policy issue.  You do want people to wear face coverings, but you'd prefer they use face coverings which can be disposed of or washed.  At the same time, there is a shortage of all types of disposable face coverings in the short term, so what can you do?  
  
The thing is that people on this sub got attached to their one or two N95 masks very early on in this cycle and they are stubbornly refusing to acknowledge that they are doing the very thing which caused the CDC and WHO to be concerned about telling the public to wear masks.  So instead of taking a nuanced view of the policy issues involved, they made a strawman to attack.",1591884412,,ftp3gvo,False,t3_h0a6a3,t1_ftls8kp,1591887659,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx
GiraffesAreSoCute,"&gt;So, health experts were urging people to NOT buy masks so that healthcare providers could have them instead. As our information on the virus changed, so did their recommendations. That's not a fuck up, it's a correction you goddamn casuals.

I agree with your general messaging but this was a fuck up. There is a very distinct difference between saying ""we need masks to protect our health care workers, who are in the front lines and much more likely to come into contact with the virus on a daily basis than anybody else"" and ""oh um, masks actually don't work...unless you're a healthcare worker, then they magically do....but you're not so please don't buy them.""

You don't lie to win people's trust in your organization. Especially not in such a blatant matter. Word choice matters, and the narrative certainly wasn't ""masks work but we need to allocate them effectively."" It was ""masks don't work despite all the leading bodies of evidence we've operated on for decades prior to this virus saying otherwise..."" Like, there really isn't any room for an ""our information on the virus changed"" when we literally had data sets from countries like Japan and South Korea (since nobody wanted to trust Chinese numbers I'll leave that out) showing their effectiveness at preventing the spread of the virus. Even if you don't take those numbers into account, this isn't our first pandemic and we already have a large body of research behind the use of masks anyway. So making the claim that they just ""don't work"" anymore is not the right move, even if it was said with good intentions (I believe that backfired tremendously and elicited a kneejerk response into the very opposite direction of where they attempted to lead people with this).

This is a fuckup. Everything else in your message is pretty fine, and I understand and am empathetic towards your need to bring this up when backlashing against the comments you're receiving. But we need to make sure that they are held accountable for missteps in order to ensure they improve as an organization.

I also deal with anxiety, and more than once I had to cut a shopping trip short because I just couldn't deal anymore with the restricted breathing, and the consciousness of staying away from people (and observing their own disregard). When my bf is with me, it helps, because he's willing to go inside the store alone, so I can stay in the car and chill.

I cope by trying to avoid unnecessary exposure, e.g. staying in as much as possible, and doing my best to go to places with a small number of people and not being there any longer than necessary. This allows me to not have to wipe down surfaces as much (and not worry about how thorough I might be, or if my bleach solution is correctly diluted). And the less exposure I have, the less I have to worry about touching my face.

I made a mask for myself that is more comfortable for me. I designed it based on how a bandanna works, but I gave it a better shape so it fits more comfortably on my face and doesn't slide. I used the metal piece from a coffee bag to mold around my nose. Having a mask I like makes a difference too, since it's not as restrictive but it's still protective.

Back then, WHO (and many other agencies) specifically stated that masks DO help but only if it's the right type and used correctly. They believed using the incorrect type and using them incorrectly would result in more spread than no mask at all. People touching their face to adjust the mask, people getting a false sense of security from the mask, etc.. they have since had more research on the matter and updated those recommendations.

As another person that replied to me said, there's a lot of revisionist history going on right now.

WHO has not changed their statements on this since February. They are just reiterating this fact even more   now from additional not yet published evidence from countries with rigorous contact tracing programs that have shown the few detected asymptomatic cases that were found in contact tracing did not drive a lot of transmission.

The spokesperson clearly distinguishes between this kind of transmission (from truly asymptomatic cases) and transmission that is pre-symptomatic, which still accounts for a high amount of the transmission.

The WHO statement about the role of transmission from truly asymptomatic carriers remains since February unchanged

WikiTextBot,"**Nightingale Pledge**

The Nightingale Pledge, named in honour of Florence Nightingale, is a modified version of the Hippocratic Oath. Lystra Gretter and a Committee for the Farrand Training School for Nurses in Detroit, Michigan, created the pledge in 1893. Gretter, inspired by the work of Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, credited the pledge to the work of her committee, but was herself considered ""the moving spirit behind the idea"" for the pledge.The Nightingale Pledge is a statement of the ethics and principles of the nursing profession in the United States, and it is not used outside of the US. It included a vow to ""abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous"" and to ""zealously seek to nurse those who are ill wherever they may be and whenever they are in need."" In a 1935 revision to the pledge, Gretter widened the role of the nurse by including an oath to become a ""missioner of health"" dedicated to the advancement of ""human welfare""—an expansion of nurses' bedside focus to an approach that encompassed public health.US nurses have recited the pledge at pinning ceremonies for decades. In recent years, many US nursing schools have made changes to the original or 1935 versions, often removing the ""loyalty to physicians"" phrasing to promote a more independent nursing profession, with its own particular ethical standards.

Healthcare workers didn't sign up for this shit, and they're only asking for the tools and protection they need to protect themselves and their patients.

Soldiers in America already get a pretty short stick.

For instance, you live in an area that ends up under a blanket ""Stay-at-Home order"" for a total of say 90 days but your essential business required you to physically show up to work 72 of those days (or whatever the math is), so you get $100 a day for a $7,200 ""hazard bonus"" at the end of this.

I would definitely support Federal level direct payment based on days worked out of the home while ""Stay-at-Home"" orders were in place in that location though. 

For instance, you live in an area that ends up under a blanket ""Stay-at-Home order"" for a total of say 90 days but your essential business required you to physically show up to work 72 of those days (or whatever the math is), so you get $100 a day for a $7,200 ""hazard bonus"" at the end of this.

EMT-basic(it's like a 4-5 week course), EMT-intermediate(like 6 months I think), and EMT-Paramedic(2ish years). In most states only actual paramedics are able to do the advanced life-saving techniques like intubation, adminstration of drugs without a doctor's orders, etc. 

Most ambulances themselves are broken down into basic life support(BLS)and advanced life support (ALS). BLS will usually have a EMT-IM and EMT-B, they can basically keep someone who isn't dying stable enough for transport. As a result a lot of private EMS companies just use BLS ambulances for low risk transports between hospitals. It is a low bar for employment qualifications(5 weeks to 6 monthsof training), and honestly low profit, so the pay is shit. Most public run EMS services, and fire-rescue services, use ALS trucks with a minimum of 1 full paramedic on board(my city runs 2 paramedics for ALS). Running ALS obviously requires more training, and is usually publicly funded, so the pay is a little better.",1586997747,,fnjf7ir,False,t3_g1stor,t1_fnirp45,1587017317,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

morrison0880,"DeFazio is a liar, and it pisses me off so fucking much that politicians like him and Bernie Sanders continue to spread this bullshit.  They either don't understand accounting practices and what the bill says (unlikely), or they're purposefully spreading misinformation to push their narrative.  Either way, people like you get screwed because you trust what they say, becoming completely misinformed on the issue and spreading that info around to others.  I'll just copy/paste here what I've written numerous times before:

The 75-year prefunding talking point is a myth.  In reality, along with the PAEA came a move from the pay-as-you-go account system the USPS was using to an accrual-based accounting system. A system every other business in the world uses, for obvious reasons. In an accrual accounting system, pensions and retirement benefits are current obligations and must be funded as such. Meaning that, if you hire someone with the promise of a salary and a pension/retirement health benefits, you have incurred an obligation to them for that salary as well as the pension. The pension is not a future obligation. It is a current obligation which was earned and needs to be accounted for and funded. The 75-years comes from the Office of Personnel Management, which it requires when calculation retirement costs. It is the same requirement when calculating Social Security, Medicare, etc. Read here for more info.  [The Office of Personnel Management requires a 75 year accounting window when calculating pension and retirement expense.]( https://www.cnbc.com/id/45018432)

From the article:

&gt;The confusion over 75 years may be due to an ""accounting"" and not an ""actuarial or funding"" issue. They only have to fund the future liability of their current or former workforce. This would include some actuarial estimate about the mortality rates of their current workers (I.e. how long they live). So a 25 year old worker would have an average life expectancy (from birth) of 78.7 years. Thus, they would have to project future retiree health benefits for this individual up to about 54 years in the future.

&gt;But for accounting purposes they must estimate the future liability over a 75 year period (according to OPM financial accounting guidelines). In this case, they would make some assumptions about new entrants into the workforce and addresses your second question.

&gt;Theoretically, these new entrants could include someone who is not born yet. While they have to account for these future liabilities on their financial statements they do not have to fund them if they are not related to their current or former workforce.""

This is further explained in the GAO reports below:

[GAO Report:  Status, Financial Outlook, and Alternative Approaches to Fund Retiree Health Benefits](http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/650511.pdf) - December 2012.  From page 7 of the report:

&gt;Contrary to statements made by some employee groups and other stakeholders, PAEA did not require USPS to prefund 75 years of retiree health benefits over a 10-year period.

[GAO Report:  Action Needed to Address Unfunded Benefit Liabilities](http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/661637.pdf) - March, 2014.  From page 9:

&gt;The amortization period is to fiscal year 2056 or, if later, 15 years from the then current fiscal year. As a result, the retiree health benefit prefunding required under PAEA occurs over a period of 50 years or more, from fiscal years 2007 through 2056 and later—not over a period of just 10 years, as has sometimes been stated.

JonRakos,"I see where you’re confused, I’ll explain it. Your prescription is good for a year, 6 months or 3 months, depending on its addictive properties or if it has particularly dangerous side effects, in most states. Some states it’s up to 18 months. It takes anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes to fill 95% of prescriptions if a pharmacy is slow, or if we’re busy, up to an hour. Very few take more than 2 hours, I’m talking like 5 to 15 a day and that’s because we don’t have it and have to have to order it. The prescription isn’t lost forever, it’s available to fill until it expires, depending on the above criteria. The point here is they were inconvenienced because they had us fill a prescription, didn’t pick it up and then became angry when it wasn’t available at all times. 

If you can imagine a shoe box, that’s about the space 2 filing bins takes up and we can fit around 30 normal sized prescriptions in that. Now, if you’ve never seen the pharmacy filing area, imagine about 50 of those show boxes, or 100 bins. Just one extra day adds 1 to 2 shoeboxes. Multiply that by 90 days. All because he didn’t want to pick it up and now doesn’t want to wait for it. And that’s not even counting oversized prescriptions, that on any given day take up about 1/2 a shoebox per prescription and we have about 50 of those at any one time. Or refrigerated prescriptions. And again, this is all ignoring state and insurance regulation on how long we can keep a prescription filled.

The CDC itself had already its funding cut before this virus broke out too.

The countries they scaled their work back in October 2019 include China by the way,

Then under John Bolton (working in Trump's administration) disbanded the National Security's Pandemic Response in 2018.

In October 2019, together with the non-renewed CDC funding the Administration also cut funding towards a Pandemic Early detection programme ending it called PREDICT. 

So it is hard to reason that he wants to save spending to reinvest in agencies when saving spending of the agencies themselves is already a hallmark policy of his administration.

Ray192,"You don't seem to understand what they were actually saying. In their full report (WHO doesn't report to countries via twitter), they clearly acknowledged the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, but couldn't find clear evidence of SUSTAINED transmission.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSKBN1ZD16J

“From the information that we have it is possible that there is **limited human-to-human transmission**, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no **sustained human-to-human transmission**,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.

There is a big difference between limited and sustained H2H transmission, as defined in WHO timeline:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/

&gt; In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. **Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.**

&gt; Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks”. The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk of a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

So no, showing that there did exist H2H transmission before Jan. 14, doesn't mean the WHO was lying, because it's fully possible that in the available data of the time, the few cases of H2H didn't present clear proof of sustained H2H.

For example the CDC had its funding reduced from working in 49 other countries to just 10 in 2018 after they did not get their funding renewed by Congress nor the Administration. The countries they scaled their work back in October 2019 include China by the way,

Then under John Bolton (working in Trump's administration) disbanded the National Security's Pandemic Response in 2018.

In October 2019, together with the non-renewed CDC funding the Administration also cut funding towards a Pandemic Early detection programme ending it called PREDICT. 

So it is hard to reason that he wants to save spending to reinvest in agencies when saving spending of the agencies themselves is already a hallmark policy of his administration.  If that is the argument, then removing funding from the CDC, from PREDICT and from the National Security's Pandemic Response in the first place shouldn't have happened... and these are just those related to this virus. He cut a lot of funding in other areas too such as the EPA.",1586914478,,fnfsemn,False,t3_g1fi31,t1_fnfpxft,1586941932,64,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Ray192,"You don't seem to understand what they were actually saying. In their full report (WHO doesn't report to countries via twitter), they clearly acknowledged the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, but couldn't find clear evidence of SUSTAINED transmission.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSKBN1ZD16J

“From the information that we have it is possible that there is **limited human-to-human transmission**, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no **sustained human-to-human transmission**,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.

There is a big difference between limited and sustained H2H transmission, as defined in WHO timeline:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/

&gt; In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. **Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.**

&gt; Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks”. The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk of a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

So no, showing that there did exist H2H transmission before Jan. 14, doesn't mean the WHO was lying, because it's fully possible that in the available data of the time, the few cases of H2H didn't present clear proof of sustained H2H.

Dr_Dankology,"That is contrary to Trump's government policies though, he consistently cut agency funding all over the place because he wishes for small and local government instead of federal agencies. 

The CDC itself had already its funding cut before this virus broke out too. For example the CDC had its funding reduced from working in 49 other countries to just 10 in 2018 after they did not get their funding renewed by Congress nor the Administration. The countries they scaled their work back in October 2019 include China by the way,

Then under John Bolton (working in Trump's administration) disbanded the National Security's Pandemic Response in 2018.

In October 2019, together with the non-renewed CDC funding the Administration also cut funding towards a Pandemic Early detection programme ending it called PREDICT. 

So it is hard to reason that he wants to save spending to reinvest in agencies when saving spending of the agencies themselves is already a hallmark policy of his administration.

Ray192,"You don't seem to understand what they were actually saying. In their full report (WHO doesn't report to countries via twitter), they clearly acknowledged the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission, but couldn't find clear evidence of SUSTAINED transmission.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who/who-says-new-china-virus-could-spread-its-warning-all-hospitals-idUSKBN1ZD16J

“From the information that we have it is possible that there is **limited human-to-human transmission**, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no **sustained human-to-human transmission**,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.

There is a big difference between limited and sustained H2H transmission, as defined in WHO timeline:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/

&gt; In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. **Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.**

&gt; Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks”. The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk of a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

So no, showing that there did exist H2H transmission before Jan. 14, doesn't mean the WHO was lying, because it's fully possible that in the available data of the time, the few cases of H2H didn't present clear proof of sustained H2H.

Ray192,"See, you people love to criticize the WHO but haven't got an  ounce of scientific education to realize what they're actually talking about. 

The WHO didn't say human-to-human wasn't possible, they said there wasn't enough evidence to go from LIMITED H2H to SUSTAINED H2H:

&gt;In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and **an unprotected caregiver.** However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.

&gt; Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks”. The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk of a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143061/

A doctor getting infected is specifically called out in Phase 3 as a possibility, that still isn't enough proof that a disease can casually infect someone without close contact.

You can argue where or not there was enough evidence at that time for SUSTAINED H2H, but you would actually have to know the difference between SUSTAINED and LIMITED, and you clearly don't.",1586913764,,fnfr6zb,False,t3_g1fi31,t1_fnfq6xw,1586941275,14,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

These claims got spread around in the media and on Reddit and basically made it sound like the the WHO was deliberately ignoring Taiwan's warnings. As a result of this and other things (like when some HK journalist started asking about the political status of Taiwan within the WHO during an interview with an WHO official and said official abruptly cut her off) Taiwan and the WHO got into a big slap fight. 

In the past few days, Taiwan released the actual email they sent to the WHO. This email reveals that instead of them warning about H2H transmission, it was merely them asking about an outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases they saw reported in the local Chinese media, NOT them providing any sort of warning. The full email stated: 

&gt; News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, CHINA. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were believed not SARS; however the samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment.

&gt; I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us.

&gt; Thank you very much in advance for your attention to this matter.

Abrickted,"This is a matter of evidence and the declaration of Human-to-human transmissible. What the WHO said was not incorrect. It is just that they did not have clear evidence at the time.

Yes, both China and WHO knew about these cases and did not declare the virus was human-to-human transmissible at the time. https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-has-limited-human-to-human-transmission-but-could-spread-wider-who

That is because “limited human-to-human transmission between close contacts” is not the same as declaring it “human-to-human transmissible”. For it to be officially declared “human-to-human transmissible” there had to be evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. https://twitter.com/WHOWPRO/status/1218741294291308545

GreenStrong,"&gt; Holding Congressional sessions in the Capitol is nearly impossible

No, it is entirely possible.  Masks greatly cut the risk of transmission, and other PPE like disposable shoe covers can really help too.  Medical personnel with proper PPE can be literally surrounded by dozens of patients coughing so hard they're in agony, and their risk of getting infected is not 100%.  

It wouldn't be easy to legislate while wearing an N95, but it is also hard to administer medical care or run a grocery checkout while wearing it, they can cope.  It actually isn't necessary for everyone to wear an N95.  If a standard is established that *everyone* wears a paper or cloth face covering, their respiratory droplets don't travel far.  That, plus meeting prior to sessions via video to streamline agendas, hand washing, disposable shoe covers, etc.can make it reasonably safe to hold legislative sessions.

If we can expect grocery workers to come face to face with hundreds of people in a day because we consider their work essential, we can expect Congresscritters to do the same.",1586986153,,fnitmsf,False,t3_g1r3ck,t1_fnighwa,1587005656,11,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

It may take some time to get your money because most of the state unemployment systems are overwhelmed and not set up to accommodate the new rules, but try to file anyway. When you finally get through, your benefits should be retroactive to the date you lost your job.

You should also apply for SNAP as soon as possible. They'll be having call volume issues as well, so you should submit your application well before the point where you aren't sure where your next meal is coming from. 

Call your landlord and tell them you'll be late on the rent because you're having trouble getting through to unemployment, but you intend to pay in full as soon as possible. You should do this even if your state has  an eviction moratorium in place.

GreenStrong,"&gt; Holding Congressional sessions in the Capitol is nearly impossible

No, it is entirely possible.  Masks greatly cut the risk of transmission, and other PPE like disposable shoe covers can really help too.  Medical personnel with proper PPE can be literally surrounded by dozens of patients coughing so hard they're in agony, and their risk of getting infected is not 100%.  

It wouldn't be easy to legislate while wearing an N95, but it is also hard to administer medical care or run a grocery checkout while wearing it, they can cope.  It actually isn't necessary for everyone to wear an N95.  If a standard is established that *everyone* wears a paper or cloth face covering, their respiratory droplets don't travel far.  That, plus meeting prior to sessions via video to streamline agendas, hand washing, disposable shoe covers, etc.can make it reasonably safe to hold legislative sessions.

GreenStrong,"&gt; Holding Congressional sessions in the Capitol is nearly impossible

No, it is entirely possible.  Masks greatly cut the risk of transmission, and other PPE like disposable shoe covers can really help too.  Medical personnel with proper PPE can be literally surrounded by dozens of patients coughing so hard they're in agony, and their risk of getting infected is not 100%.  

It wouldn't be easy to legislate while wearing an N95, but it is also hard to administer medical care or run a grocery checkout while wearing it, they can cope.  It actually isn't necessary for everyone to wear an N95.  If a standard is established that *everyone* wears a paper or cloth face covering, their respiratory droplets don't travel far.  That, plus meeting prior to sessions via video to streamline agendas, hand washing, disposable shoe covers, etc.can make it reasonably safe to hold legislative sessions.

You should qualify for the $600/week at a minimum, plus possibly some additional money based on your earnings.

It may take some time to get your money because most of the state unemployment systems are overwhelmed and not set up to accommodate the new rules, but try to file anyway. When you finally get through, your benefits should be retroactive to the date you lost your job.

You should also apply for SNAP as soon as possible. They'll be having call volume issues as well, so you should submit your application well before the point where you aren't sure where your next meal is coming from. 

Call your landlord and tell them you'll be late on the rent because you're having trouble getting through to unemployment, but you intend to pay in full as soon as possible. You should do this even if your state has  an eviction moratorium in place.

Mr_CIean,"The $1,200 does get phased out but you still get something up to $99k and $198k for singles and couples, respectively. For every $100 you make over the $75k you get 5 dollars less. So someone making $80k would get $950.

Everyone qualifies for the $600, if you're unemployed. But people over a certain income won't make as much as before because your state gives you a certain % of your income and it's often capped. But let's take someone making $80k again - let's say they are in CA, since you put the article up of SF. According to the California unemployment website that person qualifies for $450/week. They will also get $600/week. That gives you $1050/week. Yes, that is a huge reduction in pay and this person will end up worse off. In SF, that will hurt but the cities where that is true are only a couple. I live in a top 10 COL city and if you were making $80k and couldn't get by on the benefits being handed out, you are not saving properly. That's especially true since you're not going out right now - you shouldn't need to spend discretionary income on very much.

But let's be honest if you make over $75k in any city other than SF, NYC, or LA and you're living paycheck to paycheck, where you can't live on a slightly reduced salary and make rent, then you don't get a ton of sympathy from me.

GreenStrong,"&gt; Holding Congressional sessions in the Capitol is nearly impossible

No, it is entirely possible.  Masks greatly cut the risk of transmission, and other PPE like disposable shoe covers can really help too.  Medical personnel with proper PPE can be literally surrounded by dozens of patients coughing so hard they're in agony, and their risk of getting infected is not 100%.  

It wouldn't be easy to legislate while wearing an N95, but it is also hard to administer medical care or run a grocery checkout while wearing it, they can cope.  It actually isn't necessary for everyone to wear an N95.  If a standard is established that *everyone* wears a paper or cloth face covering, their respiratory droplets don't travel far.  That, plus meeting prior to sessions via video to streamline agendas, hand washing, disposable shoe covers, etc.can make it reasonably safe to hold legislative sessions.

You should also apply for SNAP as soon as possible. They'll be having call volume issues as well, so you should submit your application well before the point where you aren't sure where your next meal is coming from.

Mr_CIean,"The $1,200 does get phased out but you still get something up to $99k and $198k for singles and couples, respectively. For every $100 you make over the $75k you get 5 dollars less. So someone making $80k would get $950.

Everyone qualifies for the $600, if you're unemployed. But people over a certain income won't make as much as before because your state gives you a certain % of your income and it's often capped. But let's take someone making $80k again - let's say they are in CA, since you put the article up of SF. According to the California unemployment website that person qualifies for $450/week. They will also get $600/week. That gives you $1050/week. Yes, that is a huge reduction in pay and this person will end up worse off. In SF, that will hurt but the cities where that is true are only a couple. I live in a top 10 COL city and if you were making $80k and couldn't get by on the benefits being handed out, you are not saving properly.

It sounded a lot like the lines used when arguing for a flat tax across all income groups. You're saying that you should receive more stimulus money from the government because you live in an area, by choice, that is more expensive than other areas of the United States.

My counterpoint would be that you should push your state government to offer their own stimulus to offset that states cost of living over other states cost of living, but not to just say that you deserve more money because you've chosen to live in a geographic location that has a higher cost of living. It's the same argument used by the populace left when rich people say that they shouldn't have to pay so much more total dollars into the government when they personally are not seeing the benefits as much as other people.

GreenStrong,"&gt; Holding Congressional sessions in the Capitol is nearly impossible

No, it is entirely possible.  Masks greatly cut the risk of transmission, and other PPE like disposable shoe covers can really help too.  Medical personnel with proper PPE can be literally surrounded by dozens of patients coughing so hard they're in agony, and their risk of getting infected is not 100%.  

It wouldn't be easy to legislate while wearing an N95, but it is also hard to administer medical care or run a grocery checkout while wearing it, they can cope.  It actually isn't necessary for everyone to wear an N95.  If a standard is established that *everyone* wears a paper or cloth face covering, their respiratory droplets don't travel far.  That, plus meeting prior to sessions via video to streamline agendas, hand washing, disposable shoe covers, etc.can make it reasonably safe to hold legislative sessions.

Mr_CIean,"The $1,200 does get phased out but you still get something up to $99k and $198k for singles and couples, respectively. For every $100 you make over the $75k you get 5 dollars less. So someone making $80k would get $950.

Everyone qualifies for the $600, if you're unemployed. But people over a certain income won't make as much as before because your state gives you a certain % of your income and it's often capped. But let's take someone making $80k again - let's say they are in CA, since you put the article up of SF. According to the California unemployment website that person qualifies for $450/week. They will also get $600/week. That gives you $1050/week. Yes, that is a huge reduction in pay and this person will end up worse off. In SF, that will hurt but the cities where that is true are only a couple. I live in a top 10 COL city and if you were making $80k and couldn't get by on the benefits being handed out, you are not saving properly. That's especially true since you're not going out right now - you shouldn't need to spend discretionary income on very much.

But let's be honest if you make over $75k in any city other than SF, NYC, or LA and you're living paycheck to paycheck, where you can't live on a slightly reduced salary and make rent, then you don't get a ton of sympathy from me.

This is not over.  Europe and Asia are 3 weeks ahead of the US as far as the virus outbreak, have handled the issue better than the US and are still in lockdown.  The US has an extremely alarming growth of infections.  On top of all that the US does not have Universal Healthcare so millions dont even have healthcare/will be laid off and lose healthcare this will make the problem far worse as well.  At least in Europe if you are laid off your health is taken care of.  

1200 flat payment is a fucking joke.  Millions of people are already further down than that and still haven't received anything. Some will not for months to go.  

In the poorest western Europe nation Portugal is paying all citizens 60% of wages to stay home and building public schools programs to teach online for now.  In the beginning they paid 1 person per household 100% wages to stay home with the kids to help stop the spread.  This is why Portugal is nowhere near as bad as Spain.  

That's just 1 example.  The US is the richest nation in the world and is not doing anything to help the working class other than a bandaid.

lewdite,"Not only do I have debt I also own some debt so I’m familiar with both sides of the coin. Generally inflation is bad for fixed debt (which is most of it) because it diminishes the real returns of the loan, thus scaring away potential lenders and driving interest rights higher in an effort to entice lending (this extra interest is sometimes called “risk premium”). That’s why the fed has what we call the “dual mandate:” the fed is charged with keeping interest rates *stable* and facilitating maximum employment via monetary policy. Keeping interest rates stable makes lending money more reliable and thus increases the amount of available capital (liquidity) which generally allows the economy to operate more smoothly and be more productive because businesses have less trouble getting access to capital (loans) allowing them to hire people and do whatever they do. 

So if inflation starts moving drastically in one way or another (higher volatility) it reduces the amount of liquidity in the economy and causes a contraction in the economy overall that’s felt all the way down to the lowly part time worker because their boss can no longer secure the business loan to pay for inventory and has to close up the shop. That’s why “Quantiative Easing” (QE) has been something you might have heard, which is effectively a euphemism for “the Fed is going to forcibly inject liquidity into markets” which they do through a variety of actions I won’t discuss here but it should suffice to say that when the fed wants to do something, they have the power to get it done and nobody can stop them. 

How nearly a decade of QE and expanding deficits will affect the economy long term remains to be seen but hopefully that at least answers your question about debt and inflation. It would benefit current fixed rate borrowers and disadvantage anyone trying to get a new loan.

This is not over.  Europe and Asia are 3 weeks ahead of the US as far as the virus outbreak, have handled the issue better than the US and are still in lockdown.  The US has an extremely alarming growth of infections.  On top of all that the US does not have Universal Healthcare so millions dont even have healthcare/will be laid off and lose healthcare this will make the problem far worse as well.  At least in Europe if you are laid off your health is taken care of.  

1200 flat payment is a fucking joke.  Millions of people are already further down than that and still haven't received anything. Some will not for months to go.  

In the poorest western Europe nation Portugal is paying all citizens 60% of wages to stay home and building public schools programs to teach online for now.  In the beginning they paid 1 person per household 100% wages to stay home with the kids to help stop the spread.  This is why Portugal is nowhere near as bad as Spain.  

That's just 1 example.  The US is the richest nation in the world and is not doing anything to help the working class other than a bandaid.

BumayeComrades," &gt;The United States is a national state which has a central banking system, the Federal Reserve System, and whose currency, for domestic purposes, is not convertible into any commodity. It follows that our Federal Government has final freedom from the money market in meeting its financial requirements. Accordingly, the inevitable social and economic consequences of any and all taxes have now become the prime consideration in the imposition of taxes. In general, it may be said that since all taxes have consequences of a social and economic character, the government should look to these consequences in formulating its tax policy. All federal taxes must meet the test of public policy and practical effect. The public purpose which is served should never be obscured in a tax program under the mask of raising revenue.

&gt;What Taxes Are Really For

&gt;Federal taxes can be made to serve four principal purposes of a social and economic character. These purposes are:

&gt;1. As an instrument of fiscal policy to help stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar;

&gt;2. To express public policy in the distribution of wealth and of income, as in the case of the progressive income and estate taxes;

[The... old side?](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/amid-virus-congress-leaders-resist-call-remote-voting-69657250) Both Pelosi and McConnell are against it unless they've changed their stance.

&gt;So far, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have taken steps to reduce the risks of lawmakers in the Capitol infecting each other. But they've opposed letting them cast votes electronically from their home districts.

&gt;McConnell put his foot down Tuesday against remote voting, saying, “We'll not be doing that.""

&gt; “We will deal with the social distancing issue without fundamentally changing Senate rules,” McConnell said.

labe225,"Tough call. In all honesty, you might not like any of them if you're not drinking a cocktail.

A good starter bourbon that won't break the bank is Buffalo Trace. It's about $25 here for a fifth (750mL.)

If you can't find that, either Eagle Rare (also made by Buffalo Trace) is pretty good and will run about $30.

One of my favorites is Four Roses Single Barrel. It's usually around $35. It's a bit sweeter than the others imo.

And if you're out at a bourbon bar, maybe try something like Woodford Double Oaked. It's super woody, which masks the alcohol taste. My girlfriend (who also doesn't like straight alcohol) said it was drinkable, which is the best thing she said about any bourbon on the bourbon trail. But it's $55 for a bottle and I wouldn't personally recommend paying that much just to try it.

Now, all that being said...

If you don't like the taste of alcohol, nothing wrong with a cocktail. I usually stick to the $15-25 range for my cocktails (and by that I mean I usally use Wild Turkey 101, but sometimes splurge and use Buffalo Trace.)

My favorites are:

Whiskey Sour - 1 ounce fresh lemon juice, 1 ounce simple syrup, 2 ounces bourbon.

Kentucky Mule - 1 ounce lime juice, 1 ounce spicy ginger syrup, 2 ounces bourbon, top with club soda. Alternatively, swap the syrup and club soda for 4-6 ounces of ginger beer.

White Russian w/Bourbon (not sure the name for that) - 2 ounces bourbon, 1 ounce coffee liqueur, 1 ounce cream.

&gt;WASHINGTON — The lone member of the nascent Congressional Oversight Commission created as part of President Trump’s $2 trillion economic stimulus law is calling on the Federal Reserve to release detailed information about which companies receive loans from its emergency lending facilities and how the money is being used.

&gt;The request comes amid growing concern that disbursements from the giant economic stabilization package will be shrouded in secrecy or used improperly. In recent weeks, the Fed and the Treasury Department have rolled out a half-dozen emergency lending facilities that will allow the Fed to inject $4 trillion into almost every corner of financial markets. But who will be getting what remains murky.

&gt;In a letter sent on Wednesday to Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, Bharat Ramamurti, the only person appointed to the Congressional Oversight Commission so far, demanded clarity.

&gt;“I write to respectfully request that the Federal Reserve publicly release detailed and timely information about each individual transaction,” Mr. Ramamurti wrote. “The public deserves to know which companies are receiving taxpayer-backed lending through the Fed and on what terms, and to be able to monitor what those companies do after receiving taxpayer support.”

&gt;Mr. Ramamurti asked the Fed to provide details about the identity of borrowers, the terms of the loans and the intended use of the proceeds. He is also seeking full deal documents, information about the equity supporting the deals, and proof that the money is not going to foreign businesses or companies controlled by White House officials or members of Congress and their families.

&gt;The Fed, which avoids taking credit risk on its own, is using Treasury funds authorized by Congress to buy corporate and municipal bonds and to provide lending to mid-sized businesses as part of an effort to keep credit flowing as the coronavirus pandemic shutters large parts of the economy. Congress gave the Treasury Department $454 billion to back up the Fed’s efforts, which need to be insured against losses.

&gt;The economic relief legislation that Mr. Trump signed last month created a three-pronged oversight structure: a special inspector general within the Treasury Department, a committee of inspectors general and the Congressional Oversight Commission, which is selected by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate as well as the House Speaker and minority leader.

&gt;Mr. Ramamurti, a former aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, was the first person selected to what will ultimately be a five-person commission that will oversee the bailout fund being run by the Treasury Department.

&gt;There have been growing concerns that Mr. Trump will not comply with oversight efforts, particularly after his selection of a White House lawyer, Brian D. Miller, to serve as the special inspector general at Treasury and his firing of the Pentagon’s inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, who had been tapped by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity to lead the new Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.

&gt;The economic stimulus legislation requires the Fed and Treasury to turn over an array of information after disbursing loans. However, Mr. Ramamurti is concerned that the information could be provided in aggregate, making it difficult for watchdogs or taxpayers to know how the money is being spent and which specific companies or sectors are benefiting.

&gt;The Fed and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",1587002145,,fnjmkoe,False,t3_g24owk,t3_g24owk,1587021409,454,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

yeahmark,"Here’s some back of the envelope math to put things in perspective. The cares act authorized $2.2 trillion. As of last week there were roughly 16 million newly unemployed (surely it’s more now, but I did this math last week). You could pay each of these people 50k, and still have 1.4 trillion left over. The $1200 shut the fuck up, fuck you money amounts to a little under 100 billion. They could give everyone 12,000 and still would be roughly half of what’s been authorized. There is so much fucking waste here it’s crazy. I know there’s other programs that factor into the $2.2 T like loan forgiveness, forbearance, expanded unemployment insurance, small business loans etc., but fuck. If everyone got 12,000 dollars we wouldn’t need as much from those programs. 

Anyone that says government can’t afford social welfare, Medicare for all, free college or affordable housing or pick your favorite safety net, is woefully ignorant or complicit. 

Here’s another point, that 800 billion roughly equals the military’s annual budget. 

The 50k per unemployed person gets about one flight hour of an f-35.

All of my employees are now waiting for unemployment checks. And I was promised I would also be eligible for unemployment as a self-employed person. I'm in NV, they expect to have that system up and running around mid-May. 

Oh, and if I do somehow get any of this rapidly depleting fund the SBA has, it's a loan. So I get to pay all of my bills with a loan that is due in a year. That'll work out nice.

Unless my employees  come back to work, then some of the loan will be forgivable. The employees who worked for 20 hours a week or so and got about $300 a week and now will be getting about $800 a week in unemployment. I'm sure they'll be running back to go to work. 

And of course all of my expenses, rent, utilities, taxes, etc. just keep adding up for the next few months while I have pretty much zero customers and revenues. 

So I'm pretty sure that my business won't survive the shutdown. I'm also pretty certain that like every other bailout I've seen in the past twenty years, the money will first go to the ones who are billion dollar businesses while the majority of actual small businesses get nothing. Pretty much business as usual, but I'm thinking I may be too old to start over again. This shit is tiring.",1587008294,,fnjvz4b,False,t3_g24owk,t3_g24owk,1587026636,49,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

The $1200 shut the fuck up, fuck you money amounts to a little under 100 billion. They could give everyone 12,000 and still would be roughly half of what’s been authorized.

All of my employees are now waiting for unemployment checks. And I was promised I would also be eligible for unemployment as a self-employed person. I'm in NV, they expect to have that system up and running around mid-May. 

Oh, and if I do somehow get any of this rapidly depleting fund the SBA has, it's a loan. So I get to pay all of my bills with a loan that is due in a year. That'll work out nice.

Unless my employees  come back to work, then some of the loan will be forgivable. The employees who worked for 20 hours a week or so and got about $300 a week and now will be getting about $800 a week in unemployment. I'm sure they'll be running back to go to work. 

And of course all of my expenses, rent, utilities, taxes, etc. just keep adding up for the next few months while I have pretty much zero customers and revenues. 

So I'm pretty sure that my business won't survive the shutdown. I'm also pretty certain that like every other bailout I've seen in the past twenty years, the money will first go to the ones who are billion dollar businesses while the majority of actual small businesses get nothing.

Instead, Treasury received $3 billion more than the $439.6 billion it disbursed. Of that, $376.4 billion was repaid by the banks, auto companies, and AIG. The U.S. Treasury made a profit of $66.2 billion on those because it bought shares of the banks when prices were low and sold them when prices were high. Treasury made [$5 billion on its TARP fund investment in AIG](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/Citizens_Report_FY2013-1-28-14.pdf). The programs targeted to help homeowners allocated $37.4 billion.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency\_Economic\_Stabilization\_Act\_of\_2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008)  Early estimates for the total cost of the bailout to the government were as much as $700 billion, however TARP recovered funds totalling $441.7 billion from $426.4 billion invested, earning a $15.3 billion profit or an annualized rate of return of 0.6% and perhaps a loss when adjusted for inflation.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008#cite_note-wsj1214-3)",1587008214,,fnjvuyo,False,t3_g24owk,t1_fnjvblv,1587026571,12,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

yeahmark,"Here’s some back of the envelope math to put things in perspective. The cares act authorized $2.2 trillion. As of last week there were roughly 16 million newly unemployed (surely it’s more now, but I did this math last week). You could pay each of these people 50k, and still have 1.4 trillion left over. The $1200 shut the fuck up, fuck you money amounts to a little under 100 billion. They could give everyone 12,000 and still would be roughly half of what’s been authorized. There is so much fucking waste here it’s crazy. I know there’s other programs that factor into the $2.2 T like loan forgiveness, forbearance, expanded unemployment insurance, small business loans etc., but fuck. If everyone got 12,000 dollars we wouldn’t need as much from those programs. 

Anyone that says government can’t afford social welfare, Medicare for all, free college or affordable housing or pick your favorite safety net, is woefully ignorant or complicit. 

Here’s another point, that 800 billion roughly equals the military’s annual budget. 

The 50k per unemployed person gets about one flight hour of an f-35. 

More stimulus may be coming because this one isn’t going to help the consumers much.

BwookieBear,"My soon to be sister in law just got back from vacationing in SC... We live in Michigan. 

She’s a nurse(!!!), almost had to work in a hospital dedicated to COVID patients, and was furloughed since she was getting less hours as the number of patients decreased. 

They posted so many photos of the beach and the aquarium, no masks. Posted a photo today from the local ice cream shop from our hometown, out with people outside of her immediate family, no masks. Anything she might have caught is definitely being transferred around, and she’s like 23 so she could be asymptomatic. 

She has a bachelorette party in a week and a half as well and so far it seems like full steam ahead for the wedding in August too. I feel like they don’t care because they’re up north now where no one wears masks and in the middle of a county that has had minimal cases. 

My mom works in Traverse City (she’s the main executive, in a very small company, under the board, that provides housing for mentally disabled) and just told me a client tested positive 9 days ago and there had been workers to bring him food and the like who were exposed and then in my moms office. My fiancé’s Father and sometimes his Mother work for my mom. They are maintenance so they’re not always in the office but it seems unlikely to not be in contact with your boss for 9 days so also possible transfer of the virus. My soon to be sister in law moved back home with her parents after the furlough... so she’s bringing South Carolina to her whole family, possibly my mom, or if my mom has it, spreading it the other direction! If anyone actually had it my whole freaking family could suddenly be ill at this point. 

My sister is a cosmetologist and is starting work again next week on Monday. She said she has over 150 appointments she’s had to reschedule and people are calling her constantly. She’s also going to a birthday party for her friends daughter/to show off the new equipment. So children/teen AND adult party. She also does apartment cleanings with my mom for some extra cash...

Meanwhile I’ve been grocery shopping a few times, saw my sister once, and went up north to get a free lawn mower because our grass was getting out of control. 

I feel like I’m the only one taking it seriously.

(Why am I downvoted? I’m literally commenting about someone traveling there, being apart of the problem, and possibly bringing it back to my entire family. I’m just outlining how nonchalant the attitude is, and how easily all my family could now be sick because of it! I don’t understand what’s wrong with that? My mom had cancer!

Signs and Symptoms of a Stroke

Signs and symptoms of a stroke in both men and women include:

- Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of your face or in one arm or leg
- Loss of vision, strength, coordination, sensation, or speech, or trouble understanding speech. These symptoms may get worse over time.
- Sudden dim vision, especially in one eye
- Sudden loss of balance, sometimes along with vomiting, nausea, fever, hiccups, or trouble swallowing
- Sudden and severe headache with no other cause, followed quickly by passing out
- Fainting briefly
- Dizziness or sudden falls with no clear cause

FAST Stroke Recognition

Experts use the acronym FAST to remind people how to recognize the signs of a stroke and what to do. FAST stands for:

- **Face.** Tell the person to smile. Watch to see if their face droops.
- **Arms.** Have the person raise both their arms. Watch to see if one is weak or sags.
- **Speech.** Ask the person to say a simple phrase. Listen for slurred or strange-sounding words.
- **Time.** Every minute counts. Call 911 right away.

When to Get Emergency Care for a Stroke

If you or someone with you shows any signs of stroke, don’t wait. Quick treatment is crucial to survival and recovery.

Call for emergency services. If the symptoms pass quickly, you might have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a brief blockage of blood flow to your brain that often comes before a stroke. Don’t ignore this warning sign.

Get to the hospital right away. Some treatments must begin within a few hours of symptoms. Early treatment can often help prevent death or disability.

I was dealing with something similar (thankfully I myself am not high risk but I live with my 81 year old grandma, so) and my younger brother (who worked in a fucking nursing home, how can you do that and still be so stupid) was trying to have friends over to our house and didn’t shower when he got home from work, all simple precautions.  He actually ended up leaving and is still living at a friend’s house, because I’m too “bossy”. From what I’ve heard he’s been living it up, going to stores and restaurants without masks, etc etc. At this point I’m so fed up and done with it that long as he’s not around my grandma and I, I don’t care what he does or thinks of me. 

Now my fear is, that because my state is opening back up, my grandma will end up catching it because she’s started laxing her restrictions as well. She went and got a haircut the first week they were open again. Thank god masks are a state requirement unless you’re at a restaurant, but knowing her and my aunt (her daughter, also older and thus high risk), it’s just a matter of time before they go to a restaurant that’s “totally safe because the waiters wear masks and the tables are outside and six feet apart”. Yeah, just ignore everyone laughing and spitting and talking and eating, six feet is totally a magic number.

She had asthma as a kid but her breathing wasn’t more difficult than normal for a person with gigantic boobs... but when you have three little kids to look after your own health tends to take a back seat, so who knows, but she said she just thought she had a migraine. Then she died. 

This was before my state’s shut down, and we shutdown first. This was before the school’s were shut. This was before there were testing sites. But her husband last tested positive for antibodies and so did the people who cared for her kids afterward. The autopsy nearly didn’t happen, they just expected to find a typical heart attack or aneurysm, but the autopsy found weird, unexpected mini clots similar to covid clots.

arx4368,"You can live without dialysis as long as damage to your kidneys is slight or no more than moderate. 

Kidneys have normally huge over-capacity, you don't need more than 10% of their capacity when they are fine. Their enormous over-capacity is but a mixed blessing,  when you have some sort of problem related to kidneys - you generally won't find out before they have almost completely stopped working.

Corona, pandemic... I imagine problem lies with patients who don't have full kidney capacity (majority not even aware of it themselves) to start with  AND have corona damaging what's left. Can't even hazard a guess how many folks may live with partially functional kidneys - it depends on what you eat, drink and what's your lifestyle's like.

An example: Drinking sweet soda drinks daily, for year or two- don't be surprised when you have slight form of kidney damage eventually diagnosed. Most likely after doctor took blood sample to check on something else. That's one case where you can actually do something for yourself - reduce your daily sugar intake. 

 Majority of people with kidney dysfunction tho have it because of they have diabetes. Or it's a result of taking certain medicaments for a long time.

In females: lots of bleeding during periods may cause anemia - which will eventually cause kidney damage because they don't get enough oxygen from blood.

Goodgoditsgrowing,"The 35yo mother of three kids under four that I knew never had health problems besides being overweight. In February she dropped dead from an unexplained heart attack after a few days of headaches, muscle soreness, and loss of smell (which wasn’t a known symptom back then, just something she mentioned off hand to her husband). She had asthma as a kid but her breathing wasn’t more difficult than normal for a person with gigantic boobs... but when you have three little kids to look after your own health tends to take a back seat, so who knows, but she said she just thought she had a migraine. Then she died. 

This was before my state’s shut down, and we shutdown first. This was before the school’s were shut. This was before there were testing sites. But her husband last tested positive for antibodies and so did the people who cared for her kids afterward.

arx4368,"You can live without dialysis as long as damage to your kidneys is slight or no more than moderate. 

Kidneys have normally huge over-capacity, you don't need more than 10% of their capacity when they are fine. Their enormous over-capacity is but a mixed blessing,  when you have some sort of problem related to kidneys - you generally won't find out before they have almost completely stopped working.

Corona, pandemic... I imagine problem lies with patients who don't have full kidney capacity (majority not even aware of it themselves) to start with  AND have corona damaging what's left. Can't even hazard a guess how many folks may live with partially functional kidneys - it depends on what you eat, drink and what's your lifestyle's like.

An example: Drinking sweet soda drinks daily, for year or two- don't be surprised when you have slight form of kidney damage eventually diagnosed. Most likely after doctor took blood sample to check on something else. That's one case where you can actually do something for yourself - reduce your daily sugar intake. 

 Majority of people with kidney dysfunction tho have it because of they have diabetes. Or it's a result of taking certain medicaments for a long time.

In females: lots of bleeding during periods may cause anemia - which will eventually cause kidney damage because they don't get enough oxygen from blood.

Corona is way too unpredictable and too little is known about it. I would not want infection even if I was 15 and fairly sure to survive..",1591890758,,ftpfw9v,False,t3_h0p2bs,t1_ftpb2ue,1591894676,2,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

She had asthma as a kid but her breathing wasn’t more difficult than normal for a person with gigantic boobs... but when you have three little kids to look after your own health tends to take a back seat, so who knows, but she said she just thought she had a migraine. Then she died. 

This was before my state’s shut down, and we shutdown first. This was before the school’s were shut. This was before there were testing sites. But her husband last tested positive for antibodies and so did the people who cared for her kids afterward. The autopsy nearly didn’t happen, they just expected to find a typical heart attack or aneurysm, but the autopsy found weird, unexpected mini clots similar to covid clots. And this sort of death for young people isn’t all that unusual. It should absolutely alarm those of us who feel invincible to death from this disease.

arx4368,"You can live without dialysis as long as damage to your kidneys is slight or no more than moderate. 

Kidneys have normally huge over-capacity, you don't need more than 10% of their capacity when they are fine. Their enormous over-capacity is but a mixed blessing,  when you have some sort of problem related to kidneys - you generally won't find out before they have almost completely stopped working.

Corona, pandemic... I imagine problem lies with patients who don't have full kidney capacity (majority not even aware of it themselves) to start with  AND have corona damaging what's left. Can't even hazard a guess how many folks may live with partially functional kidneys - it depends on what you eat, drink and what's your lifestyle's like.

An example: Drinking sweet soda drinks daily, for year or two- don't be surprised when you have slight form of kidney damage eventually diagnosed. Most likely after doctor took blood sample to check on something else. That's one case where you can actually do something for yourself - reduce your daily sugar intake. 

 Majority of people with kidney dysfunction tho have it because of they have diabetes. Or it's a result of taking certain medicaments for a long time.

In females: lots of bleeding during periods may cause anemia - which will eventually cause kidney damage because they don't get enough oxygen from blood.

PEEFsmash,"Your options are:

1: Pay the higher price with money. Those who need it more will buy. Because the price is fair, there is no hoarding/flipping incentive. All masks go to people who plan to use them. Production drastically increases because there is much money to be made. Total supply of masks goes up.

2: Pay the higher price with time. Waiting in large lines, cramming into wal-mart parking lot like its a midnight release. IN a pandemic when we need to keep people separated. Supply of masks doesn't go up, because the ""currency"" used to pay for masks is people's time and that doesn't incentivize production.

3: Essentially don't make or sell masks at increased rate and ban the market from pricing appropriately via money or time (what we are currently doing). Nobody gets any masks, but we also get to read fewer stories about how ""greedy corporations"" or ""evil price gougers"" are ""making a profit off of a pandemic."" This makes us feel good.

I sell on amazon. If I want a listing to have any prominence at all (which is required if you want sales; coming up early on amazon is the same/better as being first page in a google search) you need to either a) have perfect reviews and sales for years or b) sell it for cheaper than it costs you so that amazon moves you to the front since you are cheaper than everyone else. You commit to losing money to gain future sales. 

And then you stop carrying that item, you start carrying a new item, what do you do? Do you make a new item that either will have negligible sales for years, or take losses for six months, or do you reuse the old listing that already is inflated within amazon's metrics? It's not like google where changing all your keywords might matter. Amazon already has a behind the scenes value attributed to your listing.

sub_surfer,"It would be better if we allowed ""price gouging"" for essential items too. If you had price gouging rules for Nintendo Switch, you wouldn't be able to find one anywhere. Since they have price gouging rules for masks etc., you can't find masks anywhere. Ironically, the item that society deems more important is the one that we have a shortage of because of society's rules. If mask prices were allowed to float freely then more would be produced, and they would still be available for the people who really need them since demand would match supply.

You'd think that masks are being produced 24/7 right now, but at least some of the factories that produce them are still doing a regular weekday 9-5 schedule. It's because prices are too low to justify the extra costs of producing more on a short-term basis.

chickadeedadooday,"Just a few bits of advice, from a totally non-seasoned mom of 3. 1) your hands can tell you when they have a fever and when they don't. A fever raises whole body temperature, and you'll learn what your baby's normal is.  Deviations are easy to feel eventually. And 2) ""Treat the child, not the fever"" has been the best advice I have ever heard, handed down from older family physicians. If your child has a fever, but their mood is fine and are eating/drinking/behaving normally, no need to give them any OTC meds yet. The fever is doing its job. 

I am sure I'll get some backlash about febrile seizures and shit, but honestly, stay calm and use your head.

The plastic on the head was all wore down from vibrating against metal and you could see the inside of the thing because it had been wore down so much.  Some of the container it was sitting on melted.

Learned my lesson that day about leaving the thing plugged in and leaving that drawer open to tempt the dog!!

AceyAceyAcey,"Sometime try taking a computer off wifi (so it can’t check the internet for the correct date/time), running it unplugged from power until the battery drains (so its internal clock stops ticking), waiting a few days, then plugging it back in, and going online again. One of the first things that will happen is your computer will pop up a warning saying the internal clock doesn’t match the time server it uses. Depending on your computer and operating system, you may not be able to do *anything* with the computer until you click something like “update time with server”. 

Now, imagine that not only does this happen to your computer, but also the time servers, also the bank’s computers, also your employer’s payroll, also your college’s registration and records, also the power company, and also your goddamned *car*. Do you know where to find the “update time with server” button on your car? Me neither, and I don’t want to have to tow my car to a shop just to get someone else to push that button for me. The worry was that something along these lines might happen, and not only would computers die, but so would all power companies — basically equivalent to “what happens if a worldwide EMP takes out all electrical objects in the world at the stroke of local midnight?”

A vaccine will carry its own risks, as any medical treatment does. Don't reply with some anti-vaxx ree comment, I think everyone should be vaccinated but it's important to note that some people WILL be adversely affected by the procedure, and that it's the lesser evil in this situation.

That's if we ever do get a vaccine, which is likely but not guaranteed yet.

Also remember that those consequences only happen in a minority of cases and aren't specific to COVID. Any viral infection could cause organ damage/failure and any URI can cause diminished lung capacity. I get what you mean, though.

The problem with holding out for treatments/vaccine is that we don't know for sure if the vaccine will succeed, how effective it'll be (will it prevent infection or just lessen symptoms), how fast we'll be able to roll it out.

It could be that masks really do work and are stopping the infection from spreading.  Frankly, I'm skeptical of this given how little mask use I've seen outside of big cities and how virulent the virus is supposed to be.

It could be that the virus just isn't that bad for those who aren't vulnerable and that the vulnerable are being isolated enough to reduce the impact on them.

It could be that people had more natural immunity to the virus (either through immunity to existing coronaviruses or just general immune strength) than we thought.  This would explain why nowhere in East Asia has been hit hard by the virus.

It could simply be that the virus doesn't spread well in warmer weather (though that doesn't explain Brazil).

constxd,"The economic sacrifice was for nothing anyway. The ""shutdown"" isn't what prevented the infection. The ""shutdown"" is the collection of every policy put in place with the stated intention of stopping or slowing the spread of the virus. What actually helped was banning large gatherings, closing gyms, night clubs, and churches, limiting the size of funerals, etc. What this headline leaves out is that many of the other policies (closing parks, beaches, hiking trails, etc.) actually resulted in *more* infections and that the majority of the policies were just a huge waste of time and money. Closing schools, and any businesses where the risk of transmission was low was a huge loss. Using a one-size-fits-all approach to locking down and preparing for an apocalypse was a massive disaster and resulted in virtually empty hospitals everywhere in the country except for the worst-hit hotspots, with so few patients that healthcare workers were being sent home or furloughed. Regularly scheduled cancer screenings were all canceled or pushed back months resulting in ~400,000+ missed cancer diagnoses since March. About 50% of already-diagnosed cancer patients who require regular treatment stopped attending the hospital to receive it, heart attack and stroke patients suffered at home because they were afraid to go to the hospital (despite most of them being empty and having almost no COVID-19 patients).

Not every state reports nursing home deaths vs. non-nursing home deaths, but even if you only include the data from the ones who do, 43% of all COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. were LTC residents. If we had data from every state it would surely be over 50%. Doing nothing would have resulted in a massive loss of life years, but the U.S. response, when you include all of the 2nd order effects, will likely result in an even greater loss. It was an absolute failure. There were counties completely locked down for months without ever seeing a single *case* of COVID-19.

InVultusSolis,"The int data type is a primitive type, the computer doesn't care what it's counting - it's up to us to give that int meaning. Whether you're counting seconds, number of posts, or widgets, it all boils down to the same basic representation. A 32 bit int can represent a maximum of 2^32 possible values, or 4,294,967,296. If your application treats an int as unsigned, that means that it will be represented as a value from 0 to 4,294,967,295. If your application treats it as signed, it will be represented as a value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Where they done fucked up in the past is using a signed 32 bit int in their application code. When 2038 rolls around, if an application is not patched to deal with this, that system will think the date is Friday, December 13, 1901.

Your 2nd question is a bit harder. The reason a signed 32 bit int was chosen at the time probably had everything to do with hardware limitations and/or platform dependent factors. I would imagine that while the code is old, regardless of if it's C or COBOL or FORTRAN, the systems and compilers and operating systems running that code are *not*. Depending on how timestamps are used, bringing a system up to date may be as simple as finding every bit in code where the type is referenced and changing it. But things are rarely that simple. You also need to be sure to understand where/how dates are used in the data generated by your application, and this is sort of where things go off the rails. If you have a file format that contains a date at a certain position as well as type information, your application may expect a 64 bit unsigned int, but reads the type specifier for a 32 bit signed int and then loading the record fails. Or you could have a fixed-width record that contains a 32 bit timestamp, but the application reads 64 bits worth of data and all of a sudden we're 10000 years in the future. Of course you can patch your application to account for this, but by now you can probably see how big of an issue this could be.",1591730193,,fti8wor,False,t3_gyx1i7,t1_ftht38q,1591753173,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

I haven't checked yet, but in my memory, I seem to recall that the date returned by the SQL server is different from Excel by a few days. I also recall that someone in my office once had the 1904 date option checked in their spreadsheet and I had to figure out why their dates were four years off (the SQL queries return the date as a decimal and the conversion was wrong in the 1904 compatibility mode). But somehow it manages to convert my dates correctly when not in 1904 mode. Just the counter is different if I ask Excel to convert a date to a decimal. But that's from memory, I'll have to see if that's right later.

InVultusSolis,"&gt; Are you saying that the numbers representing dates will run out of space in 2038? If so, this can't be true in all systems.

You answered your own question! It's system dependent and database dependent. Any modern OS or RDBMS will likely handle this more gracefully. However, I'v never even heard of T-SQL so I'm assuming it's some legacy system, and according to your other comment about the value overflowing, I was right.

&gt; How many systems would be affected by this?

There's no way of knowing without more specific context. I think an overall number would be hard to arrive at, but if you were to ask, ""How many state unemployment systems could be affected by this?"", the answer would be ""maybe a lot"".  If you were to ask ""how many web servers will be affected by this"", I would respond ""probably almost none"".

&gt; I'd think it's be pretty silly not to use a signed int, since by definition there are no negative dates (unless you mean the year 2020 - haha).

I think what you mean is it would be silly to not use an *unsigned* int, but there is a good reason someone might. The UNIX epoch is January 1, 1970. How do you represent dates before that? With a negative number, of course.

That said, if you're using tics with an unsigned int, I can certainly see how that would be an issue. How many systems would be affected by this?

The two are often confused by people unfamiliar with epidemiology.  We know what the CFR is.  We don't know what the IFR is because we have inadequate testing.

The biggest error is this:

\&gt; so of completed cases, 13% ended in death (&lt;--you have no idea how many actual completed cases there are since many people are asymptomatic, have gotten the virus and never noticed symptoms, were never tested, and are also ""completed cases"")

The error in all of his stats come down to asymptomatic infections (which contribute to the IFR).  Since the entire population isn't being tested, we have no idea how many asymptomatic infections there are, but estimates put it at many times the confirmed cases.  To then project the CFR on the population of future cases when you don't even know what the current amount of actual cases are (since many are asymptomatic and not tested at all) is asinine.

InVultusSolis,"The int data type is a primitive type, the computer doesn't care what it's counting - it's up to us to give that int meaning. Whether you're counting seconds, number of posts, or widgets, it all boils down to the same basic representation. A 32 bit int can represent a maximum of 2^32 possible values, or 4,294,967,296. If your application treats an int as unsigned, that means that it will be represented as a value from 0 to 4,294,967,295. If your application treats it as signed, it will be represented as a value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Where they done fucked up in the past is using a signed 32 bit int in their application code. When 2038 rolls around, if an application is not patched to deal with this, that system will think the date is Friday, December 13, 1901.

Your 2nd question is a bit harder. The reason a signed 32 bit int was chosen at the time probably had everything to do with hardware limitations and/or platform dependent factors. I would imagine that while the code is old, regardless of if it's C or COBOL or FORTRAN, the systems and compilers and operating systems running that code are *not*. Depending on how timestamps are used, bringing a system up to date may be as simple as finding every bit in code where the type is referenced and changing it. But things are rarely that simple. You also need to be sure to understand where/how dates are used in the data generated by your application, and this is sort of where things go off the rails. If you have a file format that contains a date at a certain position as well as type information, your application may expect a 64 bit unsigned int, but reads the type specifier for a 32 bit signed int and then loading the record fails. Or you could have a fixed-width record that contains a 32 bit timestamp, but the application reads 64 bits worth of data and all of a sudden we're 10000 years in the future. Of course you can patch your application to account for this, but by now you can probably see how big of an issue this could be.",1591730193,,fti8wor,False,t3_gyx1i7,t1_ftht38q,1591753173,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

Fantasia30,"Wow! That was a great article. I had no idea datetime could be so interesting. And the OA date sounds like a perfect fix for the issue described. I haven't checked yet, but in my memory, I seem to recall that the date returned by the SQL server is different from Excel by a few days. I also recall that someone in my office once had the 1904 date option checked in their spreadsheet and I had to figure out why their dates were four years off (the SQL queries return the date as a decimal and the conversion was wrong in the 1904 compatibility mode). But somehow it manages to convert my dates correctly when not in 1904 mode. Just the counter is different if I ask Excel to convert a date to a decimal. But that's from memory, I'll have to see if that's right later.

I've used Visual Basic for Applications before, and I remember thinking that it was very much like Visual Basic, and surprisingly well featured for a macro platform. I don't use it often anymore, but I've done some cool things with in the past.

InVultusSolis,"&gt; Are you saying that the numbers representing dates will run out of space in 2038? If so, this can't be true in all systems.

You answered your own question! It's system dependent and database dependent. Any modern OS or RDBMS will likely handle this more gracefully. However, I'v never even heard of T-SQL so I'm assuming it's some legacy system, and according to your other comment about the value overflowing, I was right.

&gt; How many systems would be affected by this?

There's no way of knowing without more specific context. I think an overall number would be hard to arrive at, but if you were to ask, ""How many state unemployment systems could be affected by this?"", the answer would be ""maybe a lot"".  If you were to ask ""how many web servers will be affected by this"", I would respond ""probably almost none"".

&gt; I'd think it's be pretty silly not to use a signed int, since by definition there are no negative dates (unless you mean the year 2020 - haha).

I think what you mean is it would be silly to not use an *unsigned* int, but there is a good reason someone might. The UNIX epoch is January 1, 1970. How do you represent dates before that? With a negative number, of course.

Grynn101,"Dont worry, he’s just repeating talking points from ill informed pundits.

Here is what actually happened. A group of Swedish researchers tried to copy the Imperial College SARS-COV-2 model by adjusting it to the demographics of Sweden. They reached an outlandish number of 96,000 deaths by July 1st.

Here is their research paper: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062133v1.full.pdf](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062133v1.full.pdf)

This number was then scooped up by news organizations, advocacy groups and political actors to push an narrative. The narrative was to discredit the Imperial College models which predicted 500,000 deaths in the UK and 2 millions deaths in the US if no mitigation steps were taken.

For example: [https://www.aier.org/article/imperial-college-model-applied-to-sweden-yields-preposterous-results/](https://www.aier.org/article/imperial-college-model-applied-to-sweden-yields-preposterous-results/)

[https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/sweden-tames-its-r-number-without-lockdown](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/sweden-tames-its-r-number-without-lockdown)

However, most of these reports conflate Imperial College with the Swedish research team and simply claim “Imperial College wrong by enormous margin - models were an overreaction that has destroyed the economy”. They produced a crappy paper using incorrect methods and the result was misattributed to Imperial College.

Imperial College has responded to these claims briefly via Twitter: [https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1257991339364560898](https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1257991339364560898)

InVultusSolis,"The int data type is a primitive type, the computer doesn't care what it's counting - it's up to us to give that int meaning. Whether you're counting seconds, number of posts, or widgets, it all boils down to the same basic representation. A 32 bit int can represent a maximum of 2^32 possible values, or 4,294,967,296. If your application treats an int as unsigned, that means that it will be represented as a value from 0 to 4,294,967,295. If your application treats it as signed, it will be represented as a value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Where they done fucked up in the past is using a signed 32 bit int in their application code. When 2038 rolls around, if an application is not patched to deal with this, that system will think the date is Friday, December 13, 1901.

Your 2nd question is a bit harder. The reason a signed 32 bit int was chosen at the time probably had everything to do with hardware limitations and/or platform dependent factors. I would imagine that while the code is old, regardless of if it's C or COBOL or FORTRAN, the systems and compilers and operating systems running that code are *not*. Depending on how timestamps are used, bringing a system up to date may be as simple as finding every bit in code where the type is referenced and changing it. But things are rarely that simple. You also need to be sure to understand where/how dates are used in the data generated by your application, and this is sort of where things go off the rails. If you have a file format that contains a date at a certain position as well as type information, your application may expect a 64 bit unsigned int, but reads the type specifier for a 32 bit signed int and then loading the record fails. Or you could have a fixed-width record that contains a 32 bit timestamp, but the application reads 64 bits worth of data and all of a sudden we're 10000 years in the future. Of course you can patch your application to account for this, but by now you can probably see how big of an issue this could be.",1591730193,,fti8wor,False,t3_gyx1i7,t1_ftht38q,1591753173,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

I haven't checked yet, but in my memory, I seem to recall that the date returned by the SQL server is different from Excel by a few days. I also recall that someone in my office once had the 1904 date option checked in their spreadsheet and I had to figure out why their dates were four years off (the SQL queries return the date as a decimal and the conversion was wrong in the 1904 compatibility mode). But somehow it manages to convert my dates correctly when not in 1904 mode. Just the counter is different if I ask Excel to convert a date to a decimal. But that's from memory, I'll have to see if that's right later.

InVultusSolis,"&gt; Are you saying that the numbers representing dates will run out of space in 2038? If so, this can't be true in all systems.

You answered your own question! It's system dependent and database dependent. Any modern OS or RDBMS will likely handle this more gracefully. However, I'v never even heard of T-SQL so I'm assuming it's some legacy system, and according to your other comment about the value overflowing, I was right.

&gt; How many systems would be affected by this?

There's no way of knowing without more specific context. I think an overall number would be hard to arrive at, but if you were to ask, ""How many state unemployment systems could be affected by this?"", the answer would be ""maybe a lot"".  If you were to ask ""how many web servers will be affected by this"", I would respond ""probably almost none"".

&gt; I'd think it's be pretty silly not to use a signed int, since by definition there are no negative dates (unless you mean the year 2020 - haha).

Grynn101,"Dont worry, he’s just repeating talking points from ill informed pundits.

Here is what actually happened. A group of Swedish researchers tried to copy the Imperial College SARS-COV-2 model by adjusting it to the demographics of Sweden. They reached an outlandish number of 96,000 deaths by July 1st.

Here is their research paper: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062133v1.full.pdf](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062133v1.full.pdf)

This number was then scooped up by news organizations, advocacy groups and political actors to push an narrative. The narrative was to discredit the Imperial College models which predicted 500,000 deaths in the UK and 2 millions deaths in the US if no mitigation steps were taken.

For example: [https://www.aier.org/article/imperial-college-model-applied-to-sweden-yields-preposterous-results/](https://www.aier.org/article/imperial-college-model-applied-to-sweden-yields-preposterous-results/)

[https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/sweden-tames-its-r-number-without-lockdown](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/sweden-tames-its-r-number-without-lockdown)

However, most of these reports conflate Imperial College with the Swedish research team and simply claim “Imperial College wrong by enormous margin - models were an overreaction that has destroyed the economy”. They produced a crappy paper using incorrect methods and the result was misattributed to Imperial College.

Imperial College has responded to these claims briefly via Twitter: [https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1257991339364560898](https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1257991339364560898)

Essentially, most epidemiologists and models did not predict this number, but in a similar fashion to how certain people report global warming predictions, data has been selectively manipulated and misattributed.

InVultusSolis,"The int data type is a primitive type, the computer doesn't care what it's counting - it's up to us to give that int meaning. Whether you're counting seconds, number of posts, or widgets, it all boils down to the same basic representation. A 32 bit int can represent a maximum of 2^32 possible values, or 4,294,967,296. If your application treats an int as unsigned, that means that it will be represented as a value from 0 to 4,294,967,295. If your application treats it as signed, it will be represented as a value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Where they done fucked up in the past is using a signed 32 bit int in their application code. When 2038 rolls around, if an application is not patched to deal with this, that system will think the date is Friday, December 13, 1901.

Your 2nd question is a bit harder. The reason a signed 32 bit int was chosen at the time probably had everything to do with hardware limitations and/or platform dependent factors. I would imagine that while the code is old, regardless of if it's C or COBOL or FORTRAN, the systems and compilers and operating systems running that code are *not*. Depending on how timestamps are used, bringing a system up to date may be as simple as finding every bit in code where the type is referenced and changing it. But things are rarely that simple. You also need to be sure to understand where/how dates are used in the data generated by your application, and this is sort of where things go off the rails. If you have a file format that contains a date at a certain position as well as type information, your application may expect a 64 bit unsigned int, but reads the type specifier for a 32 bit signed int and then loading the record fails. Or you could have a fixed-width record that contains a 32 bit timestamp, but the application reads 64 bits worth of data and all of a sudden we're 10000 years in the future. Of course you can patch your application to account for this, but by now you can probably see how big of an issue this could be.",1591730193,,fti8wor,False,t3_gyx1i7,t1_ftht38q,1591753173,1,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx

I haven't checked yet, but in my memory, I seem to recall that the date returned by the SQL server is different from Excel by a few days. I also recall that someone in my office once had the 1904 date option checked in their spreadsheet and I had to figure out why their dates were four years off (the SQL queries return the date as a decimal and the conversion was wrong in the 1904 compatibility mode). But somehow it manages to convert my dates correctly when not in 1904 mode. Just the counter is different if I ask Excel to convert a date to a decimal. But that's from memory, I'll have to see if that's right later.

InVultusSolis,"&gt; Are you saying that the numbers representing dates will run out of space in 2038? If so, this can't be true in all systems.

You answered your own question! It's system dependent and database dependent. Any modern OS or RDBMS will likely handle this more gracefully. However, I'v never even heard of T-SQL so I'm assuming it's some legacy system, and according to your other comment about the value overflowing, I was right.

&gt; How many systems would be affected by this?

There's no way of knowing without more specific context. I think an overall number would be hard to arrive at, but if you were to ask, ""How many state unemployment systems could be affected by this?"", the answer would be ""maybe a lot"".  If you were to ask ""how many web servers will be affected by this"", I would respond ""probably almost none"".

&gt; I'd think it's be pretty silly not to use a signed int, since by definition there are no negative dates (unless you mean the year 2020 - haha).
