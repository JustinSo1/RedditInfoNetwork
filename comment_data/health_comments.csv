I did not read this guy’s gofund me page or the article, but I am sure loss of his fingers was due to being in circulatory shock (sepsis essentially) requiring multiple pressor medications.

&gt;In the U.S., this psychological and behavioral theory of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), as the illness is now often called, has steadily lost ground in favor of a biomedical one. In 2015, a landmark report from the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) described ME/CFS as a “serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease that often can profoundly affect the lives of patients.” 

&gt;Three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its recommendations for graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as treatments for ME/CFS treatments — an implicit acknowledgement that the findings from research purporting to prove their effectiveness could not be trusted.

&gt;   

&gt;In a draft of new ME/CFS clinical guidelines released last week, a key British agency has not only explicitly rejected graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy as treatments for this condition but also the rationales behind them. 

&gt;The draft from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) acknowledges that there is “no therapy based on physical activity or exercise that is effective as a treatment or cure for ME/CFS” — just what patients have argued for years. Moreover, notes the draft, “CBT is not a cure for ME/CFS and should not be offered as such,” although the therapy may help patients “manage their symptoms.”",1605630715,,gcmg4eo,True,t3_jvw2hp,t3_jvw2hp,1605685531,50,False,Health,t5_2qh9z

This kind of test is the most sensitive, but takes around four hours from the time the sample is received to the time the data is finished being analyzed and is made available. Which is significantly less than 24 hours. So what’s the problem?

The backlog arises in the limited number of labs that are currently running the tests, the number of laboratory technicians that are trained and competent to run the samples and analyze the data, the availability of materials to run each test (pipets, especially), and the sheer number of samples that arrive. In fact, most of these samples are from nursing homes and healthcare providers who get tested each week, as mandated by the state in which I reside.

My lab is pretty small, so there’s only five us in the designated covid room at a time. Which means two people are taking inventory of the samples and ensuring that the samples match the patient information, one person is doing the sample transfer, another is preparing the isolation plates and the fifth person is helping where needed.

We’re processing ~10,000 samples a week, with a 48 hour turnaround time, but there’s no way 24 hours is feasible.

&gt;In the U.S., this psychological and behavioral theory of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), as the illness is now often called, has steadily lost ground in favor of a biomedical one. In 2015, a landmark report from the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) described ME/CFS as a “serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease that often can profoundly affect the lives of patients.” 

&gt;Three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its recommendations for graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as treatments for ME/CFS treatments — an implicit acknowledgement that the findings from research purporting to prove their effectiveness could not be trusted.

&gt;   

&gt;In a draft of new ME/CFS clinical guidelines released last week, a key British agency has not only explicitly rejected graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy as treatments for this condition but also the rationales behind them. 

&gt;The draft from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) acknowledges that there is “no therapy based on physical activity or exercise that is effective as a treatment or cure for ME/CFS” — just what patients have argued for years. Moreover, notes the draft, “CBT is not a cure for ME/CFS and should not be offered as such,” although the therapy may help patients “manage their symptoms.”",1605630715,,gcmg4eo,True,t3_jvw2hp,t3_jvw2hp,1605685531,50,False,Health,t5_2qh9z

Which is significantly less than 24 hours. So what’s the problem?

The backlog arises in the limited number of labs that are currently running the tests, the number of laboratory technicians that are trained and competent to run the samples and analyze the data, the availability of materials to run each test (pipets, especially), and the sheer number of samples that arrive. In fact, most of these samples are from nursing homes and healthcare providers who get tested each week, as mandated by the state in which I reside.

My lab is pretty small, so there’s only five us in the designated covid room at a time.

I did not read this guy’s gofund me page or the article, but I am sure loss of his fingers was due to being in circulatory shock (sepsis essentially) requiring multiple pressor medications.

Typically after 7-10 days of being on multiple pressors, we start to worry about this complication, and unfortunately it is not all that uncommon.

&gt;In the U.S., this psychological and behavioral theory of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), as the illness is now often called, has steadily lost ground in favor of a biomedical one. In 2015, a landmark report from the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) described ME/CFS as a “serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease that often can profoundly affect the lives of patients.” 

&gt;Three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its recommendations for graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as treatments for ME/CFS treatments — an implicit acknowledgement that the findings from research purporting to prove their effectiveness could not be trusted.

&gt;   

&gt;In a draft of new ME/CFS clinical guidelines released last week, a key British agency has not only explicitly rejected graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy as treatments for this condition but also the rationales behind them. 

&gt;The draft from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) acknowledges that there is “no therapy based on physical activity or exercise that is effective as a treatment or cure for ME/CFS” — just what patients have argued for years. Moreover, notes the draft, “CBT is not a cure for ME/CFS and should not be offered as such,” although the therapy may help patients “manage their symptoms.”",1605630715,,gcmg4eo,True,t3_jvw2hp,t3_jvw2hp,1605685531,50,False,Health,t5_2qh9z

&gt;In the U.S., this psychological and behavioral theory of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), as the illness is now often called, has steadily lost ground in favor of a biomedical one. In 2015, a landmark report from the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) described ME/CFS as a “serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease that often can profoundly affect the lives of patients.” 

&gt;Three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its recommendations for graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as treatments for ME/CFS treatments — an implicit acknowledgement that the findings from research purporting to prove their effectiveness could not be trusted.

&gt;   

&gt;In a draft of new ME/CFS clinical guidelines released last week, a key British agency has not only explicitly rejected graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy as treatments for this condition but also the rationales behind them. 

&gt;The draft from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) acknowledges that there is “no therapy based on physical activity or exercise that is effective as a treatment or cure for ME/CFS” — just what patients have argued for years.

‘Like a Hand Grasping’: Trump Appointees Describe the Crushing of the C.D.C.

Kyle McGowan, a former chief of staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and his deputy, Amanda Campbell, go public on the Trump administration’s manipulation of the agency.

By Noah Weiland

Published Dec. 16, 2020Updated Dec. 18, 2020, 2:18 p.m. ET

ATLANTA — Kyle McGowan, a former chief of staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and his deputy, Amanda Campbell, were installed in 2018 as two of the youngest political appointees in the history of the world’s premier public health agency, young Republicans returning to their native Georgia to dream jobs.
But what they witnessed during the coronavirus pandemic this year in the C.D.C.’s leadership suite on the 12-floor headquarters here shook them: Washington’s dismissal of science, the White House’s slow suffocation of the agency’s voice, the meddling in its messages and the siphoning of its budget.
In a series of interviews, the pair has decided to go public with their disillusionment: what went wrong, and what they believe needs to be done as the agency girds for what could be a yearslong project of rebuilding its credibility externally while easing ill feelings and self-doubt internally.
“Everyone wants to describe the day that the light switch flipped and the C.D.C. was sidelined. It didn’t happen that way,” Mr. McGowan said. “It was more of like a hand grasping something, and it slowly closes, closes, closes, closes until you realize that, middle of the summer, it has a complete grasp on everything at 

Last week, the editor in chief of the C.D.C.’s flagship weekly disease outbreak reports — once considered untouchable — told House Democrats investigating political interference in the agency’s work that she was ordered to destroy an email showing Trump appointees attempting to meddle with their publication.

The same day, the outlines of the C.D.C.’s future took more shape when President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced a slate of health nominees, including Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, as the agency’s new director, a move generally greeted with enthusiasm by public health experts.
“We are ready to combat this virus with science and facts,” she wrote on Twitter.
Mr. McGowan and Ms. Campbell — who joined the C.D.C. in their early 30s, then left together in August — said that mantra was what was most needed after a brutal year that left the agency’s authority crippled.
In November, Mr. McGowan held conversations with Biden transition officials reviewing the agency’s response to the pandemic, where he said he was candid about its failures. Among the initiatives he encouraged the new administration to plan for: reviving regular — if not daily — news briefings featuring the agency’s scientists.

Mr. McGowan and Ms. Campbell, both 34, say they tried to protect their colleagues against political meddling from the White House and Department of Health and Human Services. But an agency created to protect the nation against a public health catastrophe like the coronavirus was largely stifled by the Trump administration.

The White House insisted on reviewing — and often softening — the C.D.C.’s closely guarded coronavirus guidance documents, the most prominent public expression of its latest research and scientific consensus on the spread of the virus. The documents were vetted not only by the White House’s coronavirus task force but by what felt to the agency’s employees like an endless loop of political appointees across Washington.
Mr. McGowan recalled a White House fixated on the economic implications of public health. He and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director, negotiated with Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, over social distancing guidelines for restaurants, as Mr. Vought argued that specific spacing recommendations would be too onerous for businesses to enforce.
“It is not the C.D.C.’s role to determine the economic viability of a guidance document,” Mr. McGowan said.

They compromised anyway, recommending social distancing without a reference to the typical six-foot measurement.
One of Ms. Campbell’s responsibilities was helping secure approval for the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, a widely followed and otherwise apolitical guide on infectious disease renowned in the medical community. Over the summer, political appointees at the health department repeatedly asked C.D.C. officials to revise, delay and even scuttle drafts they thought could be viewed, by implication, as criticism of President Trump.

“It wasn’t until something was in the M.M.W.R. that was in contradiction to what message the White House and H.H.S. were trying to put forward that they became scrutinized,” Ms. Campbell said.
Dr. Tom Frieden, the C.D.C. director under President Barack Obama, said it was typical and “legitimate” to have interagency process 

“What’s not legitimate is to overrule science,” he said.
Often, Mr. McGowan and Ms. Campbell mediated between Dr. Redfield and agency scientists when the White House’s guidance requests and dictates would arrive: edits from Mr. Vought and Kellyanne Conway, the former White House adviser, on choirs and communion in faith communities, or suggestions from Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and aide, on schools.
“Every time that the science clashed with the messaging, messaging won,” Mr. McGowan said.
Episodes of meddling sometimes turned absurd, they said. In the spring, the C.D.C. published an app that allowed Americans to screen themselves for symptoms of Covid-19. But the Trump administration decided to develop a similar tool with Apple. White House officials then demanded that the C.D.C. wipe its app off its website, Mr. McGowan said.

Ms. Campbell said that at the pandemic’s outset, she was confident the agency had the best scientists in the world at its disposal, “just like we had in the past.”
“What was so different, though, was the political involvement, not only from H.H.S. but then the White House, ultimately, that in so many ways hampered what our scientists were able to do,” she said.

Top C.D.C. officials devised workarounds. Instead of posting new guidance for schools and election officials in the spring, they published “updates” to previous guidance that skipped formal review from Washington. That prompted officials in Washington to insist on reviewing updates.
Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesman, said that “all proposed guidelines and regulations with potentially sweeping effects on our economy, society and constitutional freedoms receive appropriate consultation from all stakeholders, including task force doctors, other experts and administration leaders.”
A C.D.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. McGowan and Ms. Campbell both attended the University of Georgia and saw their C.D.C. positions as homecomings. Mr. McGowan said the two institutions he revered most during his Georgia childhood were the C.D.C. and Coca-Cola.

He arrived with a résumé that made the agency’s senior ranks suspicious, he said. Like Ms. Campbell, he worked for former Representative Tom Price, first in his House office, then when he was health secretary under Mr. Trump. When he arrived at the C.D.C., Mr. McGowan told his new colleagues that he was there not to spy on or undermine them, but to support them.

Mr. McGowan and Ms. Campbell, who have since opened a health policy consulting firm, said they saw themselves as keepers of the agency’s senior scientists, whose morale had been sapped. Dr. Redfield, whose leadership has been criticized roundly by public health experts and privately by his own scientists, was rarely in Atlanta, consumed by Washington responsibilities.
That often left Mr. McGowan and Ms. Campbell as the agency’s most senior political appointees in Atlanta — two of only four at an 11,000-person agency.
Mr. McGowan, who talked to Dr. Redfield throughout the day by phone, worked in the office next to Dr. Anne Schuchat, a 32-year career staff member who is the agency’s principal deputy director and one of the country’s most respected scientists, and became a sounding board for her.
Earlier this year, Dr. Schuchat was targeted by political appointees at the health department, who began interrogating C.D.C. officials about her public comments acknowledging the seriousness of the pandemic. Dr. Schuchat asked Mr. McGowan whether she would be fired.

&gt;	“Either way, the changes so far have not resulted in strains that would likely be resistant to vaccines in development. In fact, one study by a group of scientists from several institutions including the University of Sheffield and Harvard University found that G strains might present an easier target for a vaccine because these strains have more spike proteins on their surface, which are the target of vaccine-induced antibodies.”

&gt;	““Fortunately, we found that none of these mutations are making COVID-19 spread more rapidly, but we need to remain vigilant and continue monitoring new mutations, particularly as vaccines get rolled out,” said University College of London Genetics Institute researcher Lucy van Dorp, co-author of a study that identified more than 12,700 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”

&gt;	“Still, experts who have watched influenza and HIV mutate over years, evading vaccines, warn that future mutations of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. And the best shot at avoiding changes that make the virus impervious to a vaccine remains curtailing its spread and reducing the opportunities it has to mutate.”",1608522264,,ggjwga0,False,t3_kgyv85,t1_ggi36r6,1608540940,7,False,Health,t5_2qh9z

SuperGameTheory,,,"I'm not an expert, but overall I would agree. Except on a granular scale a pathogen can be both deadly and/or contagious. In the case of Covid-19 I think we're seeing this. In a large percentage of people it's basically a cold, but for a not insignificant portion of people it's deadly (I think there's something about a gene mutation that makes some people more susceptible). So the virus spreads quickly and widely, but is also more deadly overall than a straight cold.

Incubation time is also a factor. If people are contagious and asymptomatic for years, for example, but after years the virus activates and kills everyone 100% of the time, then the virus has time to spread without notice and drop the hammer after spreading. You mention HIV, but without treatment it's pretty much a death sentence as far as I know and you may never know you have it until AIDS. Look how successful it's been by only spreading through blood.

speakhyroglyphically,,,"&gt;NEW YORK — This is the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths expected to top 3 million for the first time — due mainly to the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt;Final mortality data for this year will not be available for months. But preliminary numbers suggest that the United States is on track to see more than 3.2 million deaths this year, or at least 400,000 more than in 2019.

&gt;U.S. deaths increase most years, so some annual rise in fatalities is expected. But the 2020 numbers amount to a jump of about 15%, and could go higher once all the deaths from this month are counted.

&gt;That would mark the largest single-year percentage leap since 1918, when tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers died in World War I and hundreds of thousands of Americans died in a flu pandemic. Deaths rose 46% that year, compared with 1917.

&gt;COVID-19 has killed more than 318,000 Americans and counting. Before it came along, there was reason to be hopeful about U.S. death trends.

&gt;The nation’s overall mortality rate fell a bit in 2019, due to reductions in heart disease and cancer deaths. And life expectancy inched up — by several weeks — for the second straight year, according to death certificate data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt;But life expectancy for 2020 could end up dropping as much as three full years, said Robert Anderson of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt;The CDC counted 2,854,838 U.S. deaths last year, or nearly 16,000 more than 2018. That’s fairly good news: Deaths usually rise by about 20,000 to 50,000 each year, mainly due to the nation’s aging, and growing, population.

&gt;Indeed, the age-adjusted death rate dropped about 1% in 2019, and life expectancy rose by about six weeks to 78.8 years, the CDC reported.

&gt;The routine things in Chris Long’s life used to include biking 30 miles three times a week and taking courses toward a Ph.D. in eight-week sessions.

&gt;But since getting sick with the coronavirus in March, Mr. Long, 54, has fallen into a distressing new cycle — one that so far has landed him in the hospital seven times.

&gt;Periodically since his initial five-day hospitalization, his lungs begin filling again; he starts coughing uncontrollably and runs a low fever. Roughly 18 days later, he spews up greenish-yellow fluid, signaling yet another bout of pneumonia.

&gt;Soon, his oxygen levels drop and his heart rate accelerates to compensate, sending him to a hospital near his home in Clarkston, Mich., for several days, sometimes in intensive care.

&gt;“This will never go away,” he said, describing his worst fear. “This will be my going-forward for the foreseeable future.”

&gt;Nearly a year into the pandemic, it’s clear that recovering from Covid-19’s initial onslaught can be an arduous, uneven journey. Now, studies reveal that a significant subset of patients are having to return to hospitals, sometimes repeatedly, with complications triggered by the disease or by the body’s efforts to defeat the virus.

&gt;Even as vaccines give hope for stopping the spread of the virus, the surge of new cases portends repeated hospitalizations for more patients, taxing medical resources and turning some people’s path to recovery into a Sisyphean odyssey that upends their lives.

&gt;“It’s an urgent medical and public health question,” said Dr. Girish Nadkarni, an assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who, with another assistant professor, Dr. Anuradha Lala, is studying readmissions of Covid-19 patients.

&gt;Data on rehospitalizations of coronavirus patients are incomplete, but early studies suggest that in the United States alone, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands could ultimately return to the hospital.

&gt;A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 106,543 coronavirus patients initially hospitalized between March and July found that one in 11 was readmitted within two months of being discharged, with 1.6 percent of patients readmitted more than once.

&gt;In another study of 1,775 coronavirus patients discharged from 132 V.A. hospitals in the pandemic’s early months, nearly a fifth were rehospitalized within 60 days. More than 22 percent of them needed intensive care, and 7 percent required ventilators.

&gt;And in a report on 1,250 patients discharged from 38 Michigan hospitals from mid-March to July, 15 percent were rehospitalized within 60 days.

&gt;Recurring admissions don’t just involve patients who were severely ill the first time around.

&gt;“Even if they had a very mild course, at least one-third have significant symptomology two to three months out,” said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief of infectious diseases at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and Lifespan hospitals, who co-wrote another report. “There is a wave of readmissions that is building, because at some point these people will say ‘I’m not well.’”

&gt;Many who are rehospitalized were vulnerable to serious symptoms because they were over 65 or had chronic conditions. But some younger and previously healthy people have returned to hospitals, too.

&gt;When Becca Meyer, 31, of Paw Paw, Mich., contracted the coronavirus in early March, she initially stayed home, nursing symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, fever, extreme fatigue and hallucinations that included visions of being attacked by a sponge in the shower.

&gt;Ms. Meyer, a mother of four, eventually was hospitalized for a week in March and again in April. She was readmitted for an infection in August and for severe nausea in September, according to medical records, which labeled her condition “long haul Covid-19.”

&gt;Because she couldn’t hold down food, doctors discharged her with a nasal feeding tube connected to protein-and-electrolyte formula on a pole, which, she said, “I’m supposed to be attached to 20 hours a day.”

&gt;Feeding tube issues required hospitalization for nearly three weeks in October and a week in December. She has been unable to resume her job in customer service, spent the summer using a walker, and has had a home health nurse for weeks.

&gt;“It’s been a roller coaster since March and I’m now in the downswing of it, where I’m back to being in bed all the time and not being able to eat much, coughing a lot more, having more chest pain,” she said.

&gt;Readmissions strain hospital resources, and returning patients may be exposed to new infections or develop muscle atrophy from being bedridden. Mr. Long and Ms. Meyer said they contracted the bacterial infection C. difficile during rehospitalizations.

&gt;“Readmissions have been associated, even before Covid, with worse patient outcomes,” Dr. Mylonakis said.

&gt;Some research suggests implications for hospitals currently overwhelmed with cases. A Mount Sinai Hospital study of New York’s first wave found that patients with shorter initial stays and those not sick enough for intensive care were more likely to return within two weeks. Dr. Lala, who co-wrote the study, said the thinking at overstretched hospitals was “we have a lack of resources, so if the patients are stable get them home.”

&gt;Many rehospitalized patients have respiratory problems, but some have blood clots, heart trouble, sepsis, gastrointestinal symptoms or other issues, doctors report. Some have neurological symptoms like brain fog, “a clear cognitive issue that is evident when they get readmitted,” said Dr. Vineet Chopra, chief of hospital medicine at the University of Michigan, who co-wrote the Michigan study. “It is there, and it is real.”

&gt;Dr. Laurie Jacobs, chairwoman of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center, said causes of readmissions vary. “Sometimes there’s a lot of push to get patients out of the hospital, and they want to get out of the hospital and sometimes they’re not ready,” so they return, she said. But some appropriately discharged patients develop additional problems or return to hospitals because they lack affordable outpatient care.

&gt;Mr. Long’s ordeal began on March 9. “I couldn’t stand up without falling over,” he said.

&gt;His primary physician, Dr. Benjamin Diaczok, immediately told him to call an ambulance.

&gt;“I crawled out to the front door,” recalled Mr. Long. He was barefoot and remembers sticking out his arm to prop open the door for the ambulance crew, who found him facedown.

&gt;He awoke three days later, in the hospital, when he accidentally pulled out the tubes to the ventilator he’d been hooked up to. After two more days, he’d stabilized enough to return to the apartment where he lives alone, an hour north of Detroit.

&gt;Mr. Long had some previous health issues, including blood clots in his lungs and legs several years ago and an irregular heartbeat requiring an implanted heart monitor in 2018. Still, before Covid-19, he was “very high-functioning, very energetic,” Dr. Diaczok said.
Now, Mr. Long said: “I’ve got scarred lungs, pulmonary fibrosis, and I’m running right around 75-to-80 percent lung capacity.”

&gt;He was rehospitalized in April, May, June, July, August and September, requiring oxygen and intravenous antibiotics, potassium and magnesium.

&gt;“Something must have happened to his lungs that is making them more prone for this,” Dr. Diaczok said.

&gt;Mr. Long, a former consultant on tank systems for the military, is also experiencing brain fog that’s forced a hiatus from classes toward a Ph.D. in business convergence strategy.

&gt;“I read 10 pages in one of my textbooks and then five minutes later, after a phone call, I can’t remember what I read,” he said.

&gt;“It’s horrible, ”Dr. Diaczok said. “This is a man that thinks for a living, and he can’t do his job.”
And his heart arrhythmia, controlled since 2018, has resurfaced. Unless Mr. Long, who is 6-foot-7, sleeps at an incline on his couch, his heart skips beats, causing his monitor to prompt middle-of-the-night calls from his doctor’s office. Unable to lie in bed, “I don’t sleep through the night.”

&gt;Small exertions — “just to stand up to go do the dishes” — are exhausting. In July, he tried starting physical therapy but was told he wasn’t ready.

&gt;In August, he got up too fast, fell and “I was very confused,” he recalled. During that hospital readmission, doctors noted “altered mental status” from dehydration and treated him for pneumonia and functional lung collapse.

&gt;In late October, Mr. Long developed pneumonia again, but under Dr. Diaczok’s guidance, managed at home with high-dose oral antibiotics.

&gt;In December, when a pulmonologist administered a breathing test, “I couldn’t make it six seconds,” he said.

&gt;Mr. Long repeatedly measures his temperature and pulse oxygen, and can feel in his chest when “trouble’s coming,” he said. Determined to recover, he tries to walk short distances. “Can I make it to take out the trash?” he’ll ask himself. On a good day, he’ll walk eight feet to his mailbox.

&gt;“I’m going to be around to walk my daughters down the aisle and see my grandkids,” said Mr. Long, voice cracking. “I’m not going to let this thing win.”",1609386692,,ghkmzxg,False,t3_kn8m8s,t3_kn8m8s,1609390949,1,False,Health,t5_2qh9z

&gt;He was rehospitalized in April, May, June, July, August and September, requiring oxygen and intravenous antibiotics, potassium and magnesium.

&gt;“Something must have happened to his lungs that is making them more prone for this,” Dr. Diaczok said.

&gt;Mr. Long, a former consultant on tank systems for the military, is also experiencing brain fog that’s forced a hiatus from classes toward a Ph.D. in business convergence strategy.

&gt;“I read 10 pages in one of my textbooks and then five minutes later, after a phone call, I can’t remember what I read,” he said.

&gt;“It’s horrible, ”Dr. Diaczok said. “This is a man that thinks for a living, and he can’t do his job.”
And his heart arrhythmia, controlled since 2018, has resurfaced. Unless Mr. Long, who is 6-foot-7, sleeps at an incline on his couch, his heart skips beats, causing his monitor to prompt middle-of-the-night calls from his doctor’s office. Unable to lie in bed, “I don’t sleep through the night.”

&gt;Small exertions — “just to stand up to go do the dishes” — are exhausting. In July, he tried starting physical therapy but was told he wasn’t ready.

&gt;In August, he got up too fast, fell and “I was very confused,” he recalled. During that hospital readmission, doctors noted “altered mental status” from dehydration and treated him for pneumonia and functional lung collapse.

&gt;In late October, Mr. Long developed pneumonia again, but under Dr. Diaczok’s guidance, managed at home with high-dose oral antibiotics.

&gt;In December, when a pulmonologist administered a breathing test, “I couldn’t make it six seconds,” he said.

&gt;Mr. Long repeatedly measures his temperature and pulse oxygen, and can feel in his chest when “trouble’s coming,” he said. Determined to recover, he tries to walk short distances. “Can I make it to take out the trash?” he’ll ask himself. On a good day, he’ll walk eight feet to his mailbox.

&gt;The routine things in Chris Long’s life used to include biking 30 miles three times a week and taking courses toward a Ph.D. in eight-week sessions.

&gt;But since getting sick with the coronavirus in March, Mr. Long, 54, has fallen into a distressing new cycle — one that so far has landed him in the hospital seven times.

&gt;Periodically since his initial five-day hospitalization, his lungs begin filling again; he starts coughing uncontrollably and runs a low fever. Roughly 18 days later, he spews up greenish-yellow fluid, signaling yet another bout of pneumonia.

&gt;Soon, his oxygen levels drop and his heart rate accelerates to compensate, sending him to a hospital near his home in Clarkston, Mich., for several days, sometimes in intensive care.

&gt;“This will never go away,” he said, describing his worst fear. “This will be my going-forward for the foreseeable future.”

&gt;Nearly a year into the pandemic, it’s clear that recovering from Covid-19’s initial onslaught can be an arduous, uneven journey. Now, studies reveal that a significant subset of patients are having to return to hospitals, sometimes repeatedly, with complications triggered by the disease or by the body’s efforts to defeat the virus.

&gt;Even as vaccines give hope for stopping the spread of the virus, the surge of new cases portends repeated hospitalizations for more patients, taxing medical resources and turning some people’s path to recovery into a Sisyphean odyssey that upends their lives.

&gt;“It’s an urgent medical and public health question,” said Dr. Girish Nadkarni, an assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who, with another assistant professor, Dr. Anuradha Lala, is studying readmissions of Covid-19 patients.

&gt;Data on rehospitalizations of coronavirus patients are incomplete, but early studies suggest that in the United States alone, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands could ultimately return to the hospital.

&gt;A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 106,543 coronavirus patients initially hospitalized between March and July found that one in 11 was readmitted within two months of being discharged, with 1.6 percent of patients readmitted more than once.

&gt;In another study of 1,775 coronavirus patients discharged from 132 V.A. hospitals in the pandemic’s early months, nearly a fifth were rehospitalized within 60 days. More than 22 percent of them needed intensive care, and 7 percent required ventilators.

&gt;And in a report on 1,250 patients discharged from 38 Michigan hospitals from mid-March to July, 15 percent were rehospitalized within 60 days.

&gt;Recurring admissions don’t just involve patients who were severely ill the first time around.

&gt;“Even if they had a very mild course, at least one-third have significant symptomology two to three months out,” said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief of infectious diseases at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and Lifespan hospitals, who co-wrote another report. “There is a wave of readmissions that is building, because at some point these people will say ‘I’m not well.’”

&gt;Many who are rehospitalized were vulnerable to serious symptoms because they were over 65 or had chronic conditions. But some younger and previously healthy people have returned to hospitals, too.

&gt;When Becca Meyer, 31, of Paw Paw, Mich., contracted the coronavirus in early March, she initially stayed home, nursing symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, fever, extreme fatigue and hallucinations that included visions of being attacked by a sponge in the shower.

&gt;Ms. Meyer, a mother of four, eventually was hospitalized for a week in March and again in April. She was readmitted for an infection in August and for severe nausea in September, according to medical records, which labeled her condition “long haul Covid-19.”

&gt;Because she couldn’t hold down food, doctors discharged her with a nasal feeding tube connected to protein-and-electrolyte formula on a pole, which, she said, “I’m supposed to be attached to 20 hours a day.”

&gt;Feeding tube issues required hospitalization for nearly three weeks in October and a week in December. She has been unable to resume her job in customer service, spent the summer using a walker, and has had a home health nurse for weeks.

&gt;“It’s been a roller coaster since March and I’m now in the downswing of it, where I’m back to being in bed all the time and not being able to eat much, coughing a lot more, having more chest pain,” she said.

&gt;Readmissions strain hospital resources, and returning patients may be exposed to new infections or develop muscle atrophy from being bedridden. Mr. Long and Ms. Meyer said they contracted the bacterial infection C. difficile during rehospitalizations.

&gt;“Readmissions have been associated, even before Covid, with worse patient outcomes,” Dr. Mylonakis said.

&gt;Some research suggests implications for hospitals currently overwhelmed with cases. A Mount Sinai Hospital study of New York’s first wave found that patients with shorter initial stays and those not sick enough for intensive care were more likely to return within two weeks. Dr. Lala, who co-wrote the study, said the thinking at overstretched hospitals was “we have a lack of resources, so if the patients are stable get them home.”

&gt;Many rehospitalized patients have respiratory problems, but some have blood clots, heart trouble, sepsis, gastrointestinal symptoms or other issues, doctors report. Some have neurological symptoms like brain fog, “a clear cognitive issue that is evident when they get readmitted,” said Dr. Vineet Chopra, chief of hospital medicine at the University of Michigan, who co-wrote the Michigan study. “It is there, and it is real.”

&gt;Dr. Laurie Jacobs, chairwoman of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center, said causes of readmissions vary. “Sometimes there’s a lot of push to get patients out of the hospital, and they want to get out of the hospital and sometimes they’re not ready,” so they return, she said. But some appropriately discharged patients develop additional problems or return to hospitals because they lack affordable outpatient care.

&gt;Mr. Long’s ordeal began on March 9. “I couldn’t stand up without falling over,” he said.

&gt;His primary physician, Dr. Benjamin Diaczok, immediately told him to call an ambulance.

&gt;“I crawled out to the front door,” recalled Mr. Long. He was barefoot and remembers sticking out his arm to prop open the door for the ambulance crew, who found him facedown.

&gt;He awoke three days later, in the hospital, when he accidentally pulled out the tubes to the ventilator he’d been hooked up to. After two more days, he’d stabilized enough to return to the apartment where he lives alone, an hour north of Detroit.

&gt;Mr. Long had some previous health issues, including blood clots in his lungs and legs several years ago and an irregular heartbeat requiring an implanted heart monitor in 2018. Still, before Covid-19, he was “very high-functioning, very energetic,” Dr. Diaczok said.
Now, Mr. Long said: “I’ve got scarred lungs, pulmonary fibrosis, and I’m running right around 75-to-80 percent lung capacity.”

&gt;He was rehospitalized in April, May, June, July, August and September, requiring oxygen and intravenous antibiotics, potassium and magnesium.

&gt;“Something must have happened to his lungs that is making them more prone for this,” Dr. Diaczok said.

&gt;Mr. Long, a former consultant on tank systems for the military, is also experiencing brain fog that’s forced a hiatus from classes toward a Ph.D. in business convergence strategy.

&gt;“I read 10 pages in one of my textbooks and then five minutes later, after a phone call, I can’t remember what I read,” he said.

&gt;“It’s horrible, ”Dr. Diaczok said. “This is a man that thinks for a living, and he can’t do his job.”
