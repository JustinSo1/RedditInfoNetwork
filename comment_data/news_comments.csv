The lawyer does say that some officers asked her about what happened and she (correctly) invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to speak with them.

The lawyer/protestor featured in the article seems to be concerned about the fact that the arresting officers and those who processed her never administered a Miranda warning to her. This is incorrect. They were not legally obligated to do so. 

The lawyer does say that some officers asked her about what happened and she (correctly) invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to speak with them. That is the only point at which the officers conceivably might have needed to Mirandize her, and then only if they hoped to use her response as evidence in court — which is unlikely, considering it doesn’t sound like they were recording the interaction.

“We hired 10 contact tracers to track the spread, starting in August, but the real problem we keep running into is community cooperation. We call everyone that’s had a positive test and say, ‘Hey, this is your local health department. We’re trying to interrupt disease transmission, and we’d love your help.’ It’s nothing new,” Amber Elliott, health director in St. Francois County, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. 

“We  do the same thing for measles, mumps, and tick-borne diseases, and I’d say 99 percent of the time before COVID, people were receptive. They wanted to stop an outbreak, but now it’s all politicized.”

Elliott added, “Every time you get on the phone, you’re hoping you don’t get cussed at. Probably half of the people we call are skeptical or combative. They refuse to talk. They deny their own positive test results. They hang up. They say they’re going to hire a lawyer. They give you fake people they’ve spent time with and fake numbers. They lie and tell you they’re quarantining alone at home, but then in the background you can hear the beeping of a scanner at Walmart.”


Elliott observed, “I’ve stayed up a lot of nights trying to understand where this whole disconnect comes from. I love living in this county. I know in my heart these are good people, but it’s like we’re living on different planets. 

I have people in my own family who believe COVID is a conspiracy and our doctors are getting paid off. I’ve done press conferences and dozens of Facebook Live videos to talk about the real science. 

Even with all the other failures happening, that’s the one thing we should be celebrating: better treatments, nurses and doctors on the front lines, promising news about vaccines. But the more I talk about the facts, the more it seems to put a target on my back.”

The statistics are “scary bad,” Elliott shared. “I go off of facts and evidence-based science, and right now, all the data in Missouri is scary bad. We only have about 70,000 people in St. Francois County, but we’ve had more than 900 new cases in the last few weeks. Our positivity rate is 25 percent and rising.

Answa012,,,"edit: Wow guys! Thank you for the Reddit Gold, Platinum, and other awards!

I got bored and looked at some of the worst offenders as well as some quick data. What stands out is that there are 38 officers with over 40 complaints, with 5 of them with 72-75 complaints each.

Side note: As per the ProPublica data dump, they mentioned that these are closed cases of every active-duty police officer who had at least one substantiated allegation against them. **The records span decades, from September 1985 to January 2020.**

Out of the 33,358 allegations, this is the breakdown based on resolutions.

Unsubstantiated means the CCRB — which has limited investigative powers — was not able to confirm that the alleged incident happened and that it violated the NYPD’s rules.

|Resolution:|Total:|% of Total|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Exonerated|9,609|28.81%|
|Substantiated (Charges)|3,796|11.38%|
|Substantiated (Command Discipline A)|964|2.89%|
|Substantiated (Command Discipline B)|789|2.37%|
|Substantiated (Command Discipline)|851|2.55%|
|Substantiated (Command Lvl Instructions)|454|1.36%|
|Substantiated (Formalized Training)|1,033|3.10%|
|Substantiated (Instructions)|248|0.74%|
|Substantiated (MOS Unidentified)|1|0.00%|
|Substantiated (No Recommendations)|165|0.49%|
|Unsubstantiated|15,448|46.31%|

Breakdown of allegations by police ethnicity for all precincts. This only includes officers who have allegations against them.

|Police Ethnicity|Allegations|% of Total|
|:-|:-|:-|
|American Indian|32|0.10%|
|Asian|1,178|3.53%|
|Black|4,924|14.76%|
|Hispanic|9,150|27.43%|
|White|18,074|54.18%|

Here are the top 5 offenders for allegations. You can use the database they provided to see the type of allegations and outcomes of such. Apparently you can't search by the MOS IDs in the database... so names are added.

|MOS ID|Name of Officer|Allegations|
|:-|:-|:-|
|18731|Daniel Sbarra|75|
|25861|Mathew Reich|75|
|18530|Joseph Tallarine|73|
|19489|Gary Messina|73|
|18589|Christophe Mccormack|72|

Decided to look at the precincts with the most allegations and the numbers are jarring from the first and second place. These are only ones with over 1,000 allegations. Added information on which area the precincts serve for clarification.

|Precinct|Allegations|% of Total|
|:-|:-|:-|
|75 - Serves the easternmost portion of Brooklyn and envelopes East New York and Cypress Hills.|2,172|6.51%|
|73 - Serves a northeastern area of Brooklyn containing Brownsville and Ocean Hill.|1,163|3.49%|
|44 - Serves 1.97 square miles of the southwest portion of the Bronx: The precinct is home to the Grand Concourse, Bronx Terminal Market, and Yankee Stadium.|1,139|3.41%|
|46 - Serves the central part of the western Bronx. The precinct contains the Fordham, University Heights, Morris Heights and Mount Hope neighborhoods.|1,120|3.36%|
|67 - Serves a region in the center of Brooklyn, comprising East Flatbush and Remsen Village.|1,119|3.35%|
|79 - Serves a northern portion of Brooklyn that includes Bedford Stuyvesant and features Herbert Von King Park.|1,062|3.18%|
|40 - Serves Port Morris, Mott Haven, and Melrose.|1,009|3.02%|

Thanks to [DM\_me\_ur\_designs](https://www.reddit.com/user/DM_me_ur_designs/), he provided the following data from this source: [https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/](https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/). It appears the following breakdown is from 06/01/2020 - 06/30/2020 only.

|Precinct|Crimes|Crimes per 1000|Population|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|75|269|1.4673|183,328|

|79|129|1.4292|90,263|
|40|209|2.2842|91,497|

I don't have a lot of demographic data for each precinct but I was able to get the data from which demographic put in the allegation. For the breakdowns, some of the data was blank (uncounted).

For Precinct 75, which has the most, the data isn't surprising to me at all.

|Refused|9|0.41%|

https://www.rawstory.com/2020/11/missouri-health-care-worker-tells-shocking-tales-of-positive-people-lying-about-while-shopping-at-walmart/)


“We hired 10 contact tracers to track the spread, starting in August, but the real problem we keep running into is community cooperation. We call everyone that’s had a positive test and say, ‘Hey, this is your local health department. We’re trying to interrupt disease transmission, and we’d love your help.’ It’s nothing new,” Amber Elliott, health director in St. Francois County, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. 

“We  do the same thing for measles, mumps, and tick-borne diseases, and I’d say 99 percent of the time before COVID, people were receptive. They wanted to stop an outbreak, but now it’s all politicized.”

Elliott added, “Every time you get on the phone, you’re hoping you don’t get cussed at. Probably half of the people we call are skeptical or combative. They refuse to talk. They deny their own positive test results. They hang up. They say they’re going to hire a lawyer. They give you fake people they’ve spent time with and fake numbers. They lie and tell you they’re quarantining alone at home, but then in the background you can hear the beeping of a scanner at Walmart.”


Elliott observed, “I’ve stayed up a lot of nights trying to understand where this whole disconnect comes from. I love living in this county. I know in my heart these are good people, but it’s like we’re living on different planets. 

I have people in my own family who believe COVID is a conspiracy and our doctors are getting paid off. I’ve done press conferences and dozens of Facebook Live videos to talk about the real science. 

Even with all the other failures happening, that’s the one thing we should be celebrating: better treatments, nurses and doctors on the front lines, promising news about vaccines. But the more I talk about the facts, the more it seems to put a target on my back.”

The statistics are “scary bad,” Elliott shared. “I go off of facts and evidence-based science, and right now, all the data in Missouri is scary bad. We only have about 70,000 people in St. Francois County, but we’ve had more than 900 new cases in the last few weeks. Our positivity rate is 25 percent and rising.

* Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.” 

* Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas): “I believe the American people deserve to have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice, and the best way to ensure that happens is to have the Senate consider a nomination made by the next President. Confirming a new Supreme Court Justice during a presidential election year for a vacancy arising that same year is not common in our nation’s history; the last time it happened was in 1932. And it has been almost 130 years since a presidential election year nominee was confirmed for a vacancy arising the same year under divided government as we have today.

* Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.”

* Sen. Lindsey Graham (2016): ""I want you to use my words against me. If there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let’s let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.""

All of the above are from far earlier (mostly February) in an election year, far further from an election, than curretly.

“We hired 10 contact tracers to track the spread, starting in August, but the real problem we keep running into is community cooperation. We call everyone that’s had a positive test and say, ‘Hey, this is your local health department. We’re trying to interrupt disease transmission, and we’d love your help.’ It’s nothing new,” Amber Elliott, health director in St. Francois County, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. 

“We  do the same thing for measles, mumps, and tick-borne diseases, and I’d say 99 percent of the time before COVID, people were receptive. They wanted to stop an outbreak, but now it’s all politicized.”

Elliott added, “Every time you get on the phone, you’re hoping you don’t get cussed at. Probably half of the people we call are skeptical or combative. They refuse to talk. They deny their own positive test results. They hang up. They say they’re going to hire a lawyer. They give you fake people they’ve spent time with and fake numbers. They lie and tell you they’re quarantining alone at home, but then in the background you can hear the beeping of a scanner at Walmart.”


Elliott observed, “I’ve stayed up a lot of nights trying to understand where this whole disconnect comes from. I love living in this county. I know in my heart these are good people, but it’s like we’re living on different planets. 

I have people in my own family who believe COVID is a conspiracy and our doctors are getting paid off. I’ve done press conferences and dozens of Facebook Live videos to talk about the real science. 

Even with all the other failures happening, that’s the one thing we should be celebrating: better treatments, nurses and doctors on the front lines, promising news about vaccines. But the more I talk about the facts, the more it seems to put a target on my back.”

The statistics are “scary bad,” Elliott shared. “I go off of facts and evidence-based science, and right now, all the data in Missouri is scary bad. We only have about 70,000 people in St. Francois County, but we’ve had more than 900 new cases in the last few weeks. Our positivity rate is 25 percent and rising.

lakxmaj,,,"From the IACP on shooting at moving vehicles, which sets standards from Police Departments nationwide.

https://www.policechiefmagazine.org/presidents-message-use-force-issues/

&gt;It must be understood that the use of firearms under such conditions may present an unacceptable risk to innocent bystanders. Should the driver be wounded or killed by shots fired, the vehicle will almost certainly proceed out of control and could become a serious threat to officers and others in the area.

&gt;Officers should consider this use of deadly force only when “a person in the vehicle is immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force by means other than the vehicle,” or when the vehicle is intentionally being used as a deadly weapon and “all other reasonable means of defense have been exhausted (or are not present or practical).” Examples of circumstances in which officers are justified in shooting at a moving vehicle include when an occupant of the vehicle is shooting at the officer or others in the vicinity or, as in what has become an increasingly frequent event, the vehicle itself is being used as a deliberate means to kill others, such as a truck being driven through a crowd of innocent bystanders.

&gt;Even under these circumstances, officers should discharge their firearms at moving vehicles only when doing so will not create unreasonable risk to the safety of officers or others in the vicinity, when reasonable alternatives have been exhausted, and when failure to take such action would likely result in death or serious bodily injury. However, in cases where officers believe that the driver is intentionally attempting to run him or her down, consideration should be given to moving out of the path of the vehicle, if practical, as a possible alternative to using deadly force. The Consensus Policy recognizes that there are times when getting out of the way of the vehicle is not possible and the use of a firearm by the officer is warranted.",1605800362,,gcu5n5y,False,t3_jx2ivh,t3_jx2ivh,1605844039,4616,False,news,t5_2qh3l

“We hired 10 contact tracers to track the spread, starting in August, but the real problem we keep running into is community cooperation. We call everyone that’s had a positive test and say, ‘Hey, this is your local health department. We’re trying to interrupt disease transmission, and we’d love your help.’ It’s nothing new,” Amber Elliott, health director in St. Francois County, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. 

“We  do the same thing for measles, mumps, and tick-borne diseases, and I’d say 99 percent of the time before COVID, people were receptive. They wanted to stop an outbreak, but now it’s all politicized.”

Elliott added, “Every time you get on the phone, you’re hoping you don’t get cussed at. Probably half of the people we call are skeptical or combative. They refuse to talk. They deny their own positive test results. They hang up. They say they’re going to hire a lawyer. They give you fake people they’ve spent time with and fake numbers. They lie and tell you they’re quarantining alone at home, but then in the background you can hear the beeping of a scanner at Walmart.”


Elliott observed, “I’ve stayed up a lot of nights trying to understand where this whole disconnect comes from. I love living in this county. I know in my heart these are good people, but it’s like we’re living on different planets. 

I have people in my own family who believe COVID is a conspiracy and our doctors are getting paid off. I’ve done press conferences and dozens of Facebook Live videos to talk about the real science. 

Even with all the other failures happening, that’s the one thing we should be celebrating: better treatments, nurses and doctors on the front lines, promising news about vaccines. But the more I talk about the facts, the more it seems to put a target on my back.”

The statistics are “scary bad,” Elliott shared. “I go off of facts and evidence-based science, and right now, all the data in Missouri is scary bad. We only have about 70,000 people in St. Francois County, but we’ve had more than 900 new cases in the last few weeks. Our positivity rate is 25 percent and rising. The hospital is already at capacity.”",1605846712,,gcwt8u7,False,t3_jxht9q,t3_jxht9q,1605894526,10250,False,news,t5_2qh3l

Consider the following. Medicare Part B pays approximate $16 dollars for 100 test strips. Name brand strips are no more accurate than generic and would be sold at a loss. In order to keep their products on the shelf, [Lifescan's MAP](https://www.lifescan.com/map-rebate/) will pay the supplier additional reimbursement to keep their product competitive.

If you have commercial insurance, they have a similar kickback arrangement in place with your insurance so that your insurer pays more reimbursement than they should to your pharmacy/supplier to artificially bloat the allowable cost, and then takes money on the backend from the manufacturer.

Pharmacy is basically a gigantic case of Hollywood accounting.

LoveTruthFreedom,,,"I'm saying that all animal behavior is oriented towards some future state even if that animal is not aware of what those future states will be. The animal that wants to choose which states to go to will start to map these actions to those consequences so it can start to choose the consequences by changing actions instead of consequences just happening.

To me, reality itself is what determines the shoulds and should nots and not the organism or other organisms. For example, one should not stab themselves if they have an objective to avoid pain because stabbing causes pain. There is no way for the organism to stab itself without eventually causing pain. Reality defines this constraint whether the organism believes it or not. From what I can observe, the only way reality constrains objectives an organism can choose is that certain objectives lead to the death of the organism faster or cause pain, but the organism is still free to take those actions.

People can create a law that says it is illegal to j-walk, but people can still do it in reality if they are also willing to pay for it with the consequences. This does not mean they should not j-walk unless they also have an objective to avoid the consequences of j-walking.

If should is defined outside the constraints provided by reality, then one will get lost in an illusory world that is created by others and one can be manipulated by others telling them what they should and shouldn't do even if there are better ways of achieving objectives.",1609389733,,ghks6jj,False,t3_kmg6ry,t1_ghkqmf3,1609393623,1,False,news,t5_2qh3l

James_Solomon,,,"&gt;That’s why I say dictators like Stalin and Mao don’t represent socialism: they didn’t act in a manner which would suggest socialist ideals.

I can't speak for Stalin, but Mao has extensive writings justifying his worldview and what he did, and the same goes for Lenin as well – not just them, but let's leave it at the USSR and PRC for the time being. Both wrote about how consolidation of power was necessary to establish Marx's dictatorship of the proletariat; Marx himself wrote about how violent revolution was necessary and, drawing upon the failure of the Paris Commune, of how the proletariat had to take and hold power – for example, in his [Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm), which Lenin then draws on. 

&gt;This will make the third time that I’ve agreed there are plenty of examples of people who claim to be socialists, but clearly aren’t—yet you seem to keep insisting that we treat them as such simply because they said so. Quite frankly, I’m getting tired of coming back to this point.

Well, if you want to talk about something else, I would also quibble with your definition of fascism – another political term with no strict criteria, but which is not generally seen as ""consolidating power, venerating the military, fostering nationalism, and vilifying out-groups"". Wikipedia has a listing of various scholars' [definitions of fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism), and they all tend to be a bit more complicated than that, even if they don't agree with each other. (Offhand, I recognize Umberto Eco, Emilio Gentile, Roger Griffin, Robert Paxton, and Stanley G.

WittgensteinsNiece,,,"&gt; Right no. Ummm....okay so you clearly are using laws to hide behind...which is corruption. There is no clear indication that money goes to where it is supposed to because that’s not how spending works. And you really just don’t get it. It’s not worth that amount. They have something else of value. Like drugs. Or information. It’s fucking sketchy. And Jesus Christ you are brainwashed. “Nothing the government does is ever fishy because they follow the laws that THEY THEMSELVES PUT INTO LEGISLATION” yeah nothing sniffy about that.

&gt; I can’t imagine you have any reasoning behind that other than personal belief and since you haven’t brought anything forward your opinion is literally meaningless. You don’t even support your own context. You say I’m confused but on what grounds? Because you’re not smart enough to follow along or because you’re too trusting of your government and think that they are in fallable even though the government itself is made up of human beings who have every chance to be sinister and abuse the forms of power they have. You’re a dult and you need to learn some humility before trying to step up to the big leagues kid.

You are alleging that there is some ""fucking sketchy"" backstory involving drugs or information (?). You are alleging that the funds derived from the sale might not be going to the state department, ""because that's not how spending works"". Etc.

This is all vague conspiracy-minded handwaving.",1609390014,,ghksmc8,False,t3_kmcmvr,t1_ghknq04,1609393846,1,False,news,t5_2qh3l

Patients are becoming DNR and a rate ive never seen before, their care ends up being a morphine drop or something similar while they desaturate to death. The patient nurse ratios are terrible and everyday staff are calling in Bc they’re actually sick or faking sick which has a domino effect bc those who do show up get absolutely hammered... they end up calling in sick or not showing up as time goes on.

Alitinconcho,,,"&gt;It's not the amount of calories that cause people to gain weight from pasta and rice

ah wasnt aware the human body can defy the laws of thermodynamics. Lmao 


Yeah people lose weight on keto because meat and fat are more satiating so you eat less calories.

The fuck do you think calories are dude? Just some made up idea? Its the measure of the chemical energy in the food that the body uses for energy.. You cant gain weight unless you consume more calories than your body uses..

Calories are outdated science lmfao dude you are so fucking dumb. 

Obviously you do keto or you wouldnt be passionately raving about how carbs are the devil and defy the laws of chemistry to give you free energy that they dont contain",1609390452,,ghktajf,False,t3_kmhn5d,t1_ghkll0w,1609394174,1,False,news,t5_2qh3l
